This directory contains software that is strongly related to the loki
chip being developed in the Computer Lab. This chip contains 16 tiles
which each contain 8 cores which are simple risc processors. These
cores have a 32 bit instruction word consisting of a 7 bit op code,
three 5 bit operands, 8 bits of immediate data and a 2 bit field that
controls whether the instruction is actually executed. The 5 bit
operands can refer to one of 24 32 bit registers, 6 communication
channels that can comunicate with other cores, one register that
always holds the value zero and a register that essentially gives the
location of the current instruction.

In due course there will be an interpreter to execute these
instruction but initially the cores will run as coroutines with bodies
being written in BCPL. The implementation of the channels will be
simplified.
