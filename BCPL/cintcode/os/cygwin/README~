To install and run Cintcode BCPL under Cygwin, first install
Cygwin typically in C:\cygwin.

If you have a ploblem, try a goole search on:

how to install cygwin on windows

Get bcpl.tgz from my home page (www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mr10) and place it in
c:\cygwin

Enter cygwin, typically by double clicking on the cygwin icon on the desktop.
This icon may have the name: cygwin terminal. I normally change its name to cygwin.

This should cause you to enter cygwin prompting you for a shell command.
The command language is probably bash. Type the command: pwd
This should respond with the file name of you current directory. On my machine
the response is

/home/mr10

My user name on this machine under widows XP is mr10. Yours will be different.

Create the directory distribution and enter it by typing:

mkdir distribution
cd distribution
pwd

Check that bcpl.tgz is in /cygwin by typing

ls -lrt /cygwin

Extract all the files from bcpl.tgz by typing the following:

tar zxvf /cygwin/bcpl.tgz

Copy cygwin.bat into directory /cygwin by typing:

cp BCPL/cintcode/os/cywin/cygwin.bat /cygwin

You will need to make a minor change to cygwin.bat to replace my user id
to yours in the line

SET HOME=/home/mr10

Now leave cygwin by typing:

exit

Right click on the cygwin icon and select the properties menu item to
allow you to cause this icon to execute cygwin.bat when double clicked. 







This should rebuild Cintcode BCPL and enter it, leaving a prompt similar to:


BCPL Cintcode System (14 Jan 2012)
0.000> 

Test the system by typing:

echo hello
bcpl com/bcpl.b to junk
junk com/bcpl.b to junk
c compall
bench100

If this fails the most common fault is in the setting of
environment variables in cygwin.bat or the location of the
BCPL directories.

To diagnose the problem double-click on the Cygwin shortcut
and type the following:

cd distribution/BCPL/cintcode
cintsys -f

This traces the use of the environment variables when opening files.

cintsys -f -v

gives a more detailed trace.

Good luck!
