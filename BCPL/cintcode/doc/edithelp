Form:           EDIT  "FROM/A,TO,WITH/K,VER/K,OPT/K"
Purpose:        To edit text files.
Author:         ARA
Specification:
   If TO is specified, EDIT reads from file FROM to file TO until a
rewind occurs, when FROM becomes TO and TO becomes unset.  If TO is
not specified, then FROM is edited to a temporary file and FROM is
renamed T:EDIT-BACKUP, and the output is renamed as FROM when the
editor is wound up.  Commands are read from the current input
stream, or WITH if it is present.
   OPT specifies options: Pn sets the maximum number of previous
lines to n;  Wn sets the maximum line width.  Default is P20W120.
