To install and run Cintpos under Cygwin, first install
Cygwin typically in C:\cycwin.

Then install the BCPL Cintcode system using either bcpl.zip or
bcpl.tgz available from www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mr into, say,

C:\cygwin\home\mr10\distribution\BCPL

Copy BCPL/cintcode/os/cygwin/cygwin.bat to C:\cygwin\cygwin.bat and edit
it if neccessary. This file will set all the environment variables for
Cintsys and Cintpos. Now restart Cygwin, and check some variable setting
by typing:

echo $BCPLROOT
echo $POSROOT

If the output looks ok, build the Cintsys system by typing:

make -f makefileCygwin clean
make -f makefileCygwin

If this fails to work see the BCPL documentation for help.

Next fetch cintpos.tgz or cintpos.zip and extract all the files into,
say,

C:\cygwin\home\mr10\distribution\Cintpos

Enter Cygwin and type:

cd distribution/Cintpos/cintpos
make -f MakefileCygwin clean
make -f MakefileCygwin

This should rebuild Cintpos and enter it.

If something is wrong try

cintpos -f

or

cintpos -f -v

After successfully entering Cintpos, test the system by typing

echo hello
bcpl com/bcpl.b to junk
junk com/bcpl.b to junk
c compall
bench100
status

Good luck!
