To install and run Cintpos under Cygwin, first install
Cygwin typically in C:\cycwin. I am currently using Cygwin 1.7 which
is a significant upgrade from Cygwin 1.5.

Then install the BCPL Cintcode system using either bcpl.zip or
bcpl.tgz available from www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mr into, say,

C:\cygwin\home\mr10\distribution\BCPL

Next fetch cintpos.tgz or cintpos.zip and extract all the files into,
say,

C:\cygwin\home\mr10\distribution\Cintpos

Double-click on the BCPL shortcut (created during the BCPL installation).

Type:

cd distribution/Cintpos/cintpos
cp os/cygwin/MakefileCygwin Makefile
make clean
make

This should rebuild Cintpos and enter it.

test the system by typing

echo hello
bcpl com/bcpl.b to junk
junk com/bcpl.b to junk
c compall
bench100
status

If this fails the most common fault is in the setting of
environment variables in cygwin.bat or the location of the
Cintpos directories.

To diagnose the problem double-click on the Cygwin shortcut
and type the following:

cd distribution/Cintpos/cintpos
cintpos -f

This traces which files are being loaded.

cintpos -f -v

gives a more detailed trace.

Good luck!
