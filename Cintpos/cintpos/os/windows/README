Under slow development. It may take some time since Windows does
not provide the Posix Pthread Library.

Install and run Cintpos under Windows using Visual C.

If you do not have have Visual C installed see the end of this
document.

Extract the BCPL system (either cintpos.zip or cintpos.tgz available
from www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mr) into, say,

E:\distribution\Cintpos

Create a desktop shortcut with something like: 

Target: %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe /q /k os/windows/VC8env.bat
Start is:  E:\distribution\Cintpos\cintpos

Double-click on the shortcut

Type:

cd distribution/BCPL/cintcode
cp os/windows/MakefileVC Makefile
nmake clean
nmake

This should rebuild the Cintpos system and enter it.

Test the system by typing

echo hello
bcpl com/bcpl.b to junk
junk com/bcpl.b to junk
c compall
bench100

If this fails the most common fault is in the setting of environment
variables in, say, os\windows\VC9env.bat or the location of the BCPL
directories.

To diagnose the problem double-click on the shortcut
and type the following:

cd distribution/Cintpos/cintpos
cintpos -f

This traces which files are being loaded.

cintsys -f -v

gives a more detailed trace.

Good luck!
