BCPL CINTPOS SYSTEM

RECENT CHANGES

09/02/11
Chaned both Cintsys and Cintpos to use unix style filenames rather
than target machine style names. Thus components of a file name
are separated by '/'s (but '\'s are also allowed). Directory
filenames used by pathinput are now separated by semicolons,
although colons are allowed for systems not running under window.

The bmake commans has be added recently. See the BCPL Cintsys and
Cintpos User Guide for details.

06/05/10
Made many changes relating to the way time is measured. The timestamp
is now in days since 1 January 1970 and milli-seconds since midnight.
Relative delays are now in milli-seconds and the clock device now
takes packets containing timestamps of when they are to be released.
The concept of a clock tick is no longer present and the manifest
constant tickpersecond has been removed. The time of day is polled by
the interpreter roughly every milli-second. There is no longer a clock
device thread.

The TTYOUT device (-3) is now handled by qpkt sending the character to
standard out directly without the need to use a separate device
thread.

10/03/10
made many changes in the hope of making the use of Pthreads more
system independent, particularly for advanced processors such as
the Itanium. It is yet to be seen whether these changes are
effective.

12/01/09
Replaced dot by underscores in all global and manifest names. So
string.to.number is now string_to_number

30/08/06
Added the -d option to cintsys to trace the use of pathinput. This
helps to solve problems caused by incorrect setting of the environment
variables. Try calling:

cintsys -d

then

bcpl com/bcpl.b to junk

to see the location of successfully opened files.

20/06/06
Modified the Makefile to allow the system to be cross-compiled
for the GP2X handheld Linux gaming machine.
Renamed most files to use lower case letters to ease some problems
with windows machines. 

10/04/06
Made rdch under native BCPL read the argument line characters
before reading character from stdin, for compatibility with
cintsys BCPL.



The Cintpos System tries to remain compatible with the BCPL Cintcode
system, so look at doc/changes in that system.
