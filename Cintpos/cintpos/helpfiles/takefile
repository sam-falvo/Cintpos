TAKEFILE command
Form:           TAKEFILE   "FILE/A,FROM=MACHINE,AS/A,SERVICE/K,NOTAUTH/S"
Purpose:        To take a file from another machine.
Author:         BJK
Specification:
        FILE    - the name of the file on machine <FROM> from which to take
                  the transferred file
        FROM    - the name of the machine from which the file is to be
                  transferred
        AS      - the name of the file into which to the remote file is to
                  be transferred
        SERVICE - a name to be prefixed to "-<machine>" when constructing
                  the service name to be accessed.  Default is "givefile",
                  thus the default full service name is "givefile-<machine>".
        NOTAUTH - normally AUTHBSP: will be used to make the transfer, this
                  will include proof of the user's identity at the beginning of
                  transfer so that full access may be allowed to the user's file
                  space on the remote machine.  Quoting this switch will use
                  BSP: for the transfer which does not include the user's
                  identity.  For use with "untrusted" remote machines and
                  those that have not implemented AUTHBSP.
