*ls
LS COMMAND

Form:           ls -[ltfrnd] files ... [> file] 
Purpose:        To list the contents of a directory or directory tree.
Author:         RSC
Specification:

        ls is similar to the UNIX ls program, it lists the contents of a
directory [file] in one of three formats, the default lists the files as
a number of columns across the screen, the names of directories are followed
by a '/'.  The -l option lists the files one per line along with information
of the files like size, owner, date of creation/last update and the permissions
of the file for the owner and for everyone else. The -n option list the files
one per line without any additional information. With all the options the files
are sorted unless the -f flag in given in which case the files are printed out
in the order they are found in the directory. The -t flag will print out the
files in the order of most recent first.

        The -r flag says to list the directory recursively to include any sub-
directories. The -d flag says not to list any of the files within the given
directory but to just give information on the directory itself.

        The output of the program may be redirected into a file using the
format "> file".

Examples:

        ls              - list the files in the current directory
        ls -l > out     - list the files in the current directory, giving
                        information on the files and put the output in the
                        file out
        ls xx           - list the contents of the file xx if it is a directory,
                        otherwise just print its name.
        ls -ld home:    - give information on the creation time etc. of the
                        home directory.

Bugs:
        The program does not check for looped directories...
