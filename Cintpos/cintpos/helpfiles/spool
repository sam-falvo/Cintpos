The ring spooling system is provided on one of the VAX systems, and is
accessible to Tripos using the pseudo-device SPOOL:

The string after SPOOL: describes which printer is to be used, together
with further options. The full form is:

    SPOOL:printer,options/title

The printer name and options are as documented for the Unix `lpr' command.
Since they are being interpreted on a Unix system, all of these strings are
case sensitive. The document title is optional; if present it may appear on
a banner heading.

The ring spooler will infer the type of almost all documents by looking at
the first few bytes, so it is rarely necessary to give more than the printer
name (and even that will default to the Unix system's default printer).

Examples:

The simplest possible use:
       copy t:gcode to spool:

Explicit selection of printer, with title. Note quotes because of the space:
       copy t:gcode to "spool:electric/Chapter 1"

Use of options to get two-column landscape formatting of text on a LaserWriter:
       copy textfile to spool:elm,Ttext,l,c2/textfile
