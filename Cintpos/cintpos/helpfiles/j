*Join
Form:   JOIN  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AS/A/K,CHARS/S,WRITEINPLACE=ZAP/S"
Purpose:To concatenate zero or more files to form a new
        file.
Authors:ARA MR BJK
Modified: PB

Specification:

   The specified files are copied in order into a temporary file
which is then renamed as the AS file.  By default, copying is in
words mode.  CHARS may be used to select character mode.

   If WRITEINPLACE is specified, the result is written directly to
the AS file, rather than creating it in T: and then renaming
(rename does not work between different filing systems)

Example:        JOIN A B C AS D
