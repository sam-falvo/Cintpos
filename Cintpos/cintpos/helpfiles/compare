COMPARE command
Form:           COMPARE "file1/a,file2/a,to/k,opt/k"
Purpose:        To compare two sequential character files
Author:         DSC (Dale Strickland-Clark)
Specification:
    The COMPARE command checks two sequential character files for altered,
    inserted or deleted lines.
    Two modes are available;  difference mode produces a printout of the
    necessary to change the first file into the second.
    COMPARE options:
    The default options are:  D L- V+ X- M25 W135 P32767 R5
        B   Do not output verification messages
        D   Set differences mode.
        E   Set edit mode.
        L+  Check for the equality of line lengths.
        L-  Do not check for equal line lengths.
        Mn  Search for up to n mismatching lines (see below).
        Pn  Set printer limit of n (prevents an excessive number of differences)
        Rn  Require n (>0) lines to restore equality after mismatch (see below)
        V+  Verify in normal format.  Not allowed in edit mode.
        V-  Do not verify in normal format. Not allowed in edit mode.
        Wn  Truncate all lines after n (>0) characters
        X+  Verify in hexadecimal.  Not allowed in edit mode.
        X-  Do not verify in hex.  Not allowed in edit mode.
        Z$  Change the terminating character to $.  Only allowed in edit mode.
    After a mismatch, COMPARE requires the R setting no. of lines to
    consider it has found a match again; it will move on the M setting
    no. of lines beforegiving up.
Examples:
    COMPARE A B
    COMPARE file1 file2 OPT e TO edits
