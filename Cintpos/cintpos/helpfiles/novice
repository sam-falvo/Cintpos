FIRST TIME USERS

HELP has a lot of information in it.  If you are a first time user you can
spend your first ten or twenty minutes following up the references below
very profitably.  If you don't do it now you might never find what you will
want to find out later.

     Use HELP HOME DIRECTORY to find out about your new home directory.
     Use HELP INIT-SEQUENCE to find out how to personalize your sessions.
     Use HELP to find out how to use HELP.
     Use HELP COMMANDS for information about TRIPOS commands &c.
     Use HELP TOPICS for a short list of the sort of thing HELP knows about.

MAKING A NEW USER
     If you (or someone you know) are not yet a proper TRIPOS user
and you/he want(s) to become one send a message to IDW (with command SEND)
stating your full name (with all of your initials), PUID (if already allocated -
you won't know what one of these is if you do not have one allocated), and the
name you would like for your home directory (your initials by default).  When
you have been 'installed' you will be sent a message.
