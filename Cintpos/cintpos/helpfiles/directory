DIRECTORY NAME CONVENTIONS
Within a directory for a particular project or software component, the
subdirectories are conventionally arranged as follows:

  BCPL           BCPL sources
  ASM            Assembler sources
  LSI4-OBJ       Compiled code for LSI4s
  68000-OBJ      Compiled code for 68000s

  OLD.BCPL etc.  Backup versions of sources and object modules

  NEW.BCPL etc.  Versions to be released in the near future

  TEST.BCPL etc. Experimental new versions which may never be released

SOURCES ON TRIPOS

The BCPL sources of TRIPOS commands are in SYS:COM.BCPL and, for commands
which rely upon the RING, in SYS:COM.RING.BCPL.  BCPL sources of system
code (BLIB &c) are in SYS:SYS.BCPL.  BCPL sources which only suit the
distribution version of TRIPOS (e.g. without the lab's ring environment)
are in the directories of SYS:SYS.DISTRIBUTION (for example
SYS:SYS.DISTRIBUTION.COM.BCPL).

User written procedures are kept in SYS:G.BCPL : use HELP SOURCE LIBRARY.
For the location of other sources use HELP SYSTEM DIRECTORIES.

HOME DIRECTORY

TRIPOS users may have a directory associated with them which will be set
when they log on.  HELP USER <name> will type the name of <name>s associated
directory if he has one.  These directories are normally in the root
directory and usually are named after the user.  If a user's directory
contains a file INIT-SEQUENCE it is executed as a T command when the user
has logged on.  Use HELP INIT-SEQUENCE for more information.

The user's home directory is normally available as the assigned name HOME:
so that it can be easily accessed even when other directories are set.
TYPE HOME:INIT-SEQUENCE, for example, will always display the current user's
INIT-SEQUENCE no matter what directory is currently set.  Use
HELP ASSIGN COMMAND for further details of directory assignment.

When a user first logs on his current directory is set to his home directory
(use HELP CURRENT DIRECTORY for further information).

CURRENT DIRECTORY

    Each TRIPOS task has a current, or set, directory.  It is in this
directory that file names which do not contain a colon (:) are looked
up.  This directory can be set using the SET command.  Other commands
which can set the current directory are:
        SET        - set users home directory
        INIT       - sets a directory & executes an init sequence
        START      - loggs new user on & sets directory
        START INIT - ditto + executes INIT-SEQUENCE
   The SET and INIT commands will take the users home directory as
default if no argument is specified.
   For information about these use HELP COMMAND <command>

*deletion #H delete

*make
Directories are created by the CREATEDIR command, or by the CREATEDIR
procedure in a program.  Use HELP CREATEDIR for more information.
*:
*root
ROOT DIRECTORY

The root directory is called ":".  It is the directory in which
file name's begining with a colon are looked up.  User's directories are
normally found here.  Directories relevent to the use of the system are
available from "SYS:".

Use HELP SYSTEM DIRECTORIES for information about other system directories.
Use HELP HOME DIRECTORIES for information about a user's private directory.

DIRECTORY COMMANDS

Some of the more important TRIPOS commands which manipulate directories are
as follows:
    CREATEDIR   - create a new directory
    RENAME      - change the name of a directory
    DELETE      - delete a directory
    PROTECT     - change the protection status of a file or directory
    EX          - give information about all the files and directories
                  in a directory
    EXALL       - give information about all the files in a directory
                  and the files in any sub directories
For more information about any of these commands use HELP <command> COMMAND.
For information about other examine commands use HELP EXAMINE COMMANDS.

COMMAND DIRECTORY

The directory from which commands are looked up is normally :C by
default, but this can be changed using SET COMDIR (use HELP COMMAND SET
for more information).
*:h
DIRECTORY :H

This directory is used to hold handler tasks for particular real or pseudo
devices.  The name refers to a different physical directory for each machine
type, so that compiled code for the correct machine is obtained.
A call of FINDINPUT or FINDOUTPUT on a name of the form XYZ:qwerty
will first look in the assignments list to see if XYZ: is an existing
assigned name.  If this fails, then an attempt will be made to load code
from the file :H.XYZ and run it as a task to handle the stream.

Examples of device handlers which live in :H are LP:, BSP: and PIPE:.
*:l
DIRECTORY :L

This directory is used to hold code which is dynamically loaded by the
system or commands.  In particular, it is used for released modules
designed to be used via the library routine CALLSEG.

The name :L refers to a different physical directory for each type of machine,
so that the appropriate compiled code is obtained.
** #I directory
For information about a particular aspect of directories type any of the
following:
  COMMANDS          - commands available for manipulating files
  PROTECTION
  CREATION
  EXAMINE           - information about the files in a particular directory
  FORMAT            - the format of TRIPOS files and directories
  SYSTEM            - a list of system directories
  TITLES            - syntax of file titles
  OWNER             - TRIPOS users with their own directories.
