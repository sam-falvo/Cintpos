DISASM command
Form:           DISASM  "FROM/A,TO/K,OPT/K"
Purpose:        To disassemble a program to LSI4 assembler
Author:         RDE
Specification:
        This accepts TRIPOS binary input file FROM, and includes local and
    external relocation information in the output.  DISASM outputs the
    corresponding disassembly to the TO stream, or to the current output
    stream if TO is absent.
        Options to the disassembler can be specified using the OPT keyword.
    Options are:       U       unformatted binary
                       M       map all TRIPOS binary types
                       E       print symbol settings
                       A       disassemble ALL words
                       N       narrower output
                       Q       quick - don't disassemble hunks

Examples:
                DISASM binary OPT=n
                DISASM bin.file to t:listing
