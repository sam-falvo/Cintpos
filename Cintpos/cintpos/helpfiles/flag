TASK FLAGS
    Each TRIPOS task has a word of flag bits which it can test and which
any task may set. These are intended for simple signalling purposes
between tasks. The kernel primitives SETFLAGS and TESTFLAGS (q.v.) are provided
for indivisible setting and inspecting of the flags.

    The low order flags have conventional meanings:

  Flag 1 (#X0001): 'break' flag - instructs a program to finish, or abandon
                   the current action (in an interactive program). Most
                   commands respond to this flag.

  Flag 2 (#X0002): 'CLI break' - this is inspected by CLIs between commands.
                   If set, it will cause a command sequence to be abandoned
                   cleanly between commands.

  Flag 4 (#X0004): Used by a few programs. In particular:
                   Stops the REPEAT command.
                   Causes MONITOR to rewrite the screen.
                   Stops the Ring Services Task.

    Flags 1, 2, 4, and 8 can be set in the task to which terminal input
is currently directed by typing control-B, control-C, control-D, and
control-E respectively.  Use HELP BREAK HANDLING and HELP CONTROL CHARACTERS
for more information.

    The BREAK command can also be used to set these four flags.
    They can also be set after a VTP break (see HELP VTP BREAK).
