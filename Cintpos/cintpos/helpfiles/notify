NOTIFY command
Form:           NOTIFY  machine  message
Purpose:        To send a message to the user of machine
Author:         IDW
Specification:
        This command does not use RDARGS.  The first item on the line is
    taken as the name of the machine to which the message is to be sent.  The
    rest of the line is the message which is sent.

        The message is terminated by the semicolon character ";" by default,
    but if the message is contained in either single or double quotation
    marks, then the message is taken as being until the next such character,
    or end of line.

        Unlike WTO, NOTIFY does not look up the name of its service in the
    name server, thus allowing messages to be sent to the 68000 machines.

Examples:

    NOTIFY BROWN I didn't know you cared!
    NOTIFY DELTA Oh for "set terminal nomessage"
