WS command
Form:           WS    "from/a,to/k,0/s,1/s,2/s,3/s,*
                      *browse/s,bbc/s,init/k,noinit/s,*
                      *inits/k,find/k,line/k,cifer"
                (just go WS FILENAME)
Purpose:        To edit a file (or some files).
Author:         WRS
Specification:

    WS is a full screen text editor. It runs on 68000s and on LSI4s,
but the LSI4 version is cut down and less helpful - the 68000 one is
recommended for beginners. It runs on Cifers or on BBC Computers.

    This text editor is based on MicroPro WordStar (available on CP/M
machines) and is EASY TO USE.  It is not necessary to learn dozens of new
commands because the information that you want, and the commands
available, are always on the screen. Once you know the menus you can
switch them off through the 'help' menu (^J), leaving more room for your
text on the screen.

    Main features:
        Rewind not necessary - wind forwards or backwards in text as required
        Menu driven, easy to learn and use - friendly.
        Tried and tested layout of keyboard commands, copied from WordStar.
        Insert mode or replace mode for text entry.
        Powerful block, column block, find and replace commands.
        'Undelete' key - makes catastophic accidents less painful
        Automatic indentation for entry of structured program source.
        Split screen - edit or examine two files at once,
          or a file and a tripos CLI session.
        programmable keys and keyboard macros
        Use any screen mode on a BBC terminal
        escape to TRIPOS possible in the middle of edits

    Calling the editor:
        FROM        is the file to be edited
        TO          is the file to edit to - the default is back to FROM
        BROWSE      does not allow the file to be changed
        0, 1, 2, 3  initial help level - default is 3, most helpful
        BBC,CIFER   specify terminal type - Tripos usually knows anyway
        FIND string         find this string on entry to the editor
        LINE no             start editing at this line
        INITS string        obey this string on entry to the editor
        NOINIT              do NOT obey file "home:ws-init" on entry
    Only FROM and TO are of interest to the first-time user.

    Backup files are kept in T:EDIT-BACKUP

before running WS in the standard CLI.
