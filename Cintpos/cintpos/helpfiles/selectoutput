SELECTOUTPUT
      A stream is selected for output.
      res := selectoutput ( stream )
      The specified stream, which should be the result of  a
call  of  findoutput ( q.v. ), is selected and made the cur-
rent output stream. A true result is returned.
      If the stream is not valid then the routine will abort
with code 187. If this abort is continued  then  the  stream
will  be  selected anyway; however this is likely to lead to
fatal consequences later.
