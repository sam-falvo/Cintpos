There is a gateway machine providing a Transport Level connection between
the ring and JANET.  It is known as CAXU.

To access it from the ring side, a CR82 connection should be opened to the
service "X25A" with the called address in the OPEN block containing the
required JANET address, starting with the number of the first-hop JANET host.
For incoming calls, the called address in the Connect Message should be a
nameserver name.

See HELP CAXU for info on the machine itself.
