TRIPOS

TRIPOS is the name of this operating system.
It is a portable operating system which runs on a variety of minicomputers.
It can be executed on the allocatable machines in the Processor Bank.

For a general introduction see the file TRIPOS.PRINT.TRIDOC on Phoenix.

There are several variants of TRIPOS available from the Resource Manager
at present (10.07.84). These include:

   TRIPOS       - the version normally used by lab members
   MACE-TRIPOS  - ditto (68000s only)
   S-TRIPOS     - the version normally used by CST and Diploma students
   FS-TRIPOS    - a restricted version which does not use the filing machine
   MICRO-TRIPOS - (LSI4s only) a cut-down version giving more space

MACE-TRIPOS will only run on 68000s - it is a similar version to TRIPOS
except that it utilizes the special 6809 ring interface that 68000s have
(called a MACE) more thoroughly.  The effect is that byte streams are faster.

S-TRIPOS knows about a different set of users to the others - but in general
anyone that can use TRIPOS etc. can use S-TRIPOS (although not vice versa)
There is a rather more limited set of commands available on S-TRIPOS.

FS-TRIPOS can only be used by those with FULL access to the operating sytem
(i.e. the TRIPOS MANAGER and one or two others).  It is very much slower than
TRIPOS, because it cannot take advantage of the caching that the FILING
MACHINE has.  Also its filing system is completely unprotected.

MICRO-TRIPOS can be used (in desperation!) to get more space on an LSI4.
It has no DEBUG task, no ring services task, minimal filing system cache,
no names in compiled code, etc ...

TRIPOS runs a several different kinds of machine including
   68000s  LSI4s  Novas  PDP11s  8086s  and  16032s
Only 68000s and LSI4s are to be found in the processor bank.
