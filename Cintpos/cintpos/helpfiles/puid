*puids
PUIDS
     Permanent Unique IDentifiers are assigned to any object that needs a
name on the Ring.  Each user has an associated PUID.  Use HELP PUID to find
the PUID of a user, or HELP USER for more information.
     Use HELP AUTHENTICATION for information about other aspects of the
Ring's object representation system and HELP UID SETS for information about
UIDs in general.
*create
NEW PUID CREATION

There is a NEWPUID service provided on the Ring from which new PUIDs can be
obtained.  The command "newpuid" calls this service to allocate a new PUID.
