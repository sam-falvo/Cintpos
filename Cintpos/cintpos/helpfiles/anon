ANONYMOUS DIRECTORIES

     Client systems may request the creation of one or more "ANONYMOUS"
directories, by using the commands currently in :mike.m68k-c.anon (or lsi4-c).
This takes two arguments. The first is an assignment name which will be set
up, and the second is the name of any object in the filing system. The command
will cause the creation of a directory on the same pack as the named object,
and assign the specified name to it. For example:

     :mike.m68k-c.anon x: home:bcpl
     :mike.m68k-c.anon x: fred.wombat    // anonymous directory X: on same pack
                                         // as object fred.wombat
     :mike.m68k-c.anon x:                // .... on same pack as current dir.

     These may be removed by ":mike.m68k-c.anon delete x:", etc.
     Anonymous directories have the following advantages:
(..i) Directory searching within the anonymous directory is an in-store
      operation in the filing machine and is thus extremely fast.
(.ii) Empty files are created in advance for use in anonymous directories, so
      that logical file creation (ie., findoutput or findupdate) is fast.
(iii) Rename, especially within an anonymous directory, is much faster than a
      rename in conventional directories.
     There is, of course, a disadvantage:
(.iv) If a client machine crashes, then the anonymous directories associated
      with that client session WILL BE TOTALLY AND IRRETRIEVABLY LOST. You have
      been warned.
     Finally, the (current) limitations are:
(..v) Anonymous directories are only available on packs 3, 5 and 10 and
(.vi) There is a limit of one hundred anonymous directory objects on each pack,
      to be shared between all clients (so don't be greedy!!)
(vii) ALIAS is not permitted in any context where anonymous directory entries
      are involved. However, rename in any combination works.
