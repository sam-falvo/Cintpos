REX is a command executor, providing extended command line interpreter
facilities in conjunction with the Tripos Shell.  REX includes an
interpreter for a programming language which is sufficiently powerful
to enable simple "throw-away" programs to be written, and has a sufficiently
good interface to the Shell to enable complex command sequences to be
constructed easily.

Relevant documents are:

    a)  The REX Executor      -    Documentation of the REX language
    b)  The REX Shell         -    Documentation of the Shell

See HELP REX xxx for information on REX Shell commands.
