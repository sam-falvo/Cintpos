PIPE: Device

   The pseudo-device PIPE: can be used to set up I/O streams between processes
within TRIPOS.  If PIPE:name is opened for both input and output, then the
two resulting streams are joined.  The streams may be opened in either order,
and up to 10 pipes may exist simultaneously.
   Pipes are managed by a pipe handler task, which is created when the first
pipe is opened, and is unloaded by "dismount pipe:". The pipe handler may also
be loaded using the command "mount pipe:".
   The command PIPEINFO may be used to discover what pipes exist, their names
and their states.

Simple (but futile) example:

RUN EX TO PIPE:1
RUN TYPE PIPE:1

More useful example:

RUN CS INPUT PIPE:filetoibm .from.tripos ABC1 SECRET
CS PACK file TO PIPE:filetoibm

packs a directory into a pipe and sends the result to the IBM.
