RING SERVICES TASK

The Ring services task monitors a particular Ring port and fires up tasks for
SSP or OPEN requests which arrive on that port. It reads the file
:INFO.RING-SERVICES to determine the mapping between Ring function codes and
filenames of programs to be run.

Processor Bank TRIPOS systems have this task loaded by default. It will commit
suicide if task flag 4 is set, so you can kill it by typing control-D at it
or using BREAK n D.

The LOADRINGSERV command will load the Ring services task.

See the file TRIPOS.ALL.SPEC:RINGSW on Phoenix for details of how ring
services are written.

CAMBRIDGE RING

The Cambridge Ring is a high speed local area communications network with
a raw bandwidth of 10 MHz.  A number of machines are connected to it, and
together they form a distributed system which includes the Processor Bank.
This runs most of the Tripos sessions within the Laboratory.  You can send
files etc. over the ring (and out to other networks).

The use of the ring from TRIPOS is described in the document "TRIPOS Ring
Software" which can be printed from the 370 file TRIPOS.ALL.SPEC:RINGSW
