*gasm #H asm
*gcc
Form:           GCC from/a,to
Purpose:        To convert between GCODE versions 2 and 3
Author:         PB
Specification:

        Reads the From file, converting the GCODE format. Version 2 is
produced by OGCAL and version 3 by the current GCAL.  Version 2 used control
characters and record boundaries, so it was hard to transport.

        Use this program before shipping GCODE between CAP, TRIPOS and the 370.
*gcode
GCODE is an intermediate code produced by the paginator GCAL.

It may be sent directly to the Canon printer via the devices canon: and
scanon:, and is interpreted there.  It may also be converted to PostScript
for feeding to PostScript driven printers (e.g. the Apple LaserWriter).
See HELP GTOPS for more info.

The program GTYPE is provided to format it for various type of output device,
e.g. Diablo printer.  See HELP GTYPE.

Pages of a GCODE file may be selected using GPAGE - see HELP on this.

To transport or convert old (version 2) GCODE to current (v. 3) see HELP GCC.
*getbyte #H byte
*getfile #H takefile
*get2bytes
GET2BYTES

  This is a function in MLIB for fetching a 16-bit word from a
specified offset (in 16 bit words) in a BCPL vector. It is the
16-bit analogue of BYTEGET.

  BYTEPAIR := GET2BYTES(VECTOR, OFFSET)
*gks
GKS stands for Graphics Kernel System. This is a graphics package for which
we have an implementation written in Modula-2. Peter Robinson (T74) has details.
*globin
GLOBIN
    A KLIB procedure which initialises the Global Vector of a TRIPOS
task.
                   RESULT  :=  GLOBIN( segment )
    Initialises the global vector with the definitions in the code of
the segment.  A segment is a list of sections - each of which may have
label and procedure variables to be assigned to particular globals.
    Use HELP LKED ALL for more information about segment layout.

*gpage
Form:           GPAGE FROM/A,TO/A,PAGES/K,TRACE
Purpose:        To allow partial printing of a GCODE file
Author:         NJO
Source code:    sys:com.bcpl.gpage
Specification:

   Reads a GCODE file from FROM and writes one to TO, omitting the pages
which are not required.  The required pages may be specified on the command
line using the PAGES parameter.  If this parameter is omitted then pages
will be prompted for.

   Pages are specified as a list of numbers separated by commas, or on
separate lines when specified interactively.  A range consisting of two
numbers separated by a minus sign may also be given.  Numbers need not be
given in order.
*graphics
TRIPOS does not provide any graphics packages as such.  Graphics work is
being done on the Rainbow workstation, but this is essentially of a private
nature.  Alternatives are the GKS graphics package on the VAX, or the CAMPLOT
or GINO packages on the IBM.
*grep
*egrep
*fgrep
Form:           GREP [ option ] ... expression  [ file ] ...
Purpose:        To print lines in the given files matching the expression
Author:         Unix program ported by DRM
Source code:    Source is on Unix (in C)
Specification:

   This is virtually the same as the Unix "grep" command.  See Unix help
for full details.  It does not use RDARGS, and can only run on a 68000.

   Some of the options are:

      -n   the line numbers of printed lines are given
      -i   case of letters is equated
      -l   just the files which contain matching lines are listed
      -v   only non-matching lines are printed
      -c   just a count of matching lines is printed

   In all cases, if more than one file is specified then the name of the
file is prefixed to the printed line.

   Some of the things an expression may include are:

      \c   matches character c
      ^    matches beginning of line
      $    matches end of line
      .    matches any single character
      [s]  matches any single character in the string s
*gtops
GTOPS command
Form:           GTOPS "from/a,to/k,header/k,trailer/k,opt/k"
Purpose:        Converting GCODE to POSTSCRIPT
Author:         Philip Hazel (Computing Service)
Tripos version: PB
Source:         :com.gtops

  GTOPS converts GCODE (output from the GCAL paginator) to POSTSCRIPT,
  primarily for printer on an apple laser writer.

  FROM is the manditory input file

  TO is the destination file (dafeults to the Balfour LaserWriter)

  HEADER is the postscript header (defaults to sys:gcal.gtops-pshdr)

  TRAILER is the postscript trailer (no default)

  OPT gives the keywords.  See the Spec on PHOENIX, or :info.spec.gtops-xx
      where xx is one of raw, gcode, ps, ps-a5 or ps-a6

  The library "a4atl" should be used when GCALling the document

  **** Use GTOPS ****

  GC2PS converts GCODE (output from the GCAL paginator) to POSTSCRIPT,
  primarily for printer on an apple laser writer.

  FROM is the manditory input file

  TO is the destination file (dafeults to the Balfour LaserWriter)

  HDR is the postscript header (defaults to sys:gcal.gc2ps-pshdr)

  FIRST and LAST define the pages to be processes (defaults to all)

  PAGES specifies the pages to be printed. This is of the form
    range [,range]* where range is page | from-to | from-*

  COPIES specifies the number of copies to be printed (generates a request)

  MARGIN specifies the margin to be left              (generates a request)

  REQUEST allows the user to supply a GCAL "request" string such as:
        COPIES n    produce <n> copies of the document (use COPIES)
        MARGIN n    set left margin to <x> points      (use MARGIN)
        GET file    includes Postscript file <file> in output
        MANUALFEED  subsequent pages use the manual feed mechanism
        LANDSCAPE   print subsequent pages in landscape mode

  EVEN or ODD define whether only odd or even pages are to be printed
    (defaults to both)

  VER produces `chatty' messages, such as the version number

  A5 (or A5ONA4) produces two A5 pages on a single A4 page
