TRIPOS MAIL

Tripos can send to and receive from any of the JNT or ARPA mail sites.  The
Cambridge processor bank machines are in domain "uk.ac.cam.cl.trps"
(full form UK.AC.Cambridge.Computer-Lab.Tripos), and mail can be
sent from outside to "xxx@uk.ac.cam.cl.trps", where "xxx" is a Tripos
user id.  From within Tripos, use the SEND program to send mail, the MAIL
program to read mail, and the MAILBOX program to create or delete a mailbox.
