READWORDS
        To read a vector directly from the currently selected input.

        RESULT := READWORDS(VECTOR, N)

        Reads in the next 'n' words into vector 'v' from the currently selected
input stream.  Note that READWORDS cannot be used in conjunction with RDCH since
RDCH will do its own buffering.

Arguments:

VECTOR:    a vector large enough to hold N words
N:         the number of words to be read from the currently selected input
           stream

Normal Return:

RESULT=N
           N words will have been read into VECTOR!0 to VECTOR!(N-1)
RESULT=0, RESULT2=0
           Stream exhausted
RESULT<0
           Stream exhausted after reading [ABS RESULT] words read into
           VECTOR!0 to VECTOR!((ABS RESULT)-1).

Error Return:

0<=RESULT<N
           An error was detected after reading RESULT words into VECTOR!0
           to VECTOR!(RESULT-1).  Consult the relevant documentation for
           interpretation of the RESULT2 code.  (use HELP FAULT COMMAND)

Abort Condition:

        The detection of extermely serious errors may result in a system
abort (e.g. if a disc is discovered to be inconsistent).

Notes:

        When reading disc files a 'stream exhausted' condition will always
be returned on reading the last word of a file.
