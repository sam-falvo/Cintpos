NEWLINE
      To write a newline to the current output stream.
      newline ()
      A  newline  character  is  written  to  the  currently
selected output stream. The routine is simply a call of wrch
( '*N' ).
*newpage
The BCPL routine "newpage" does not exist under TRIPOS.  Use "wrch( '*P' )"
as an alternative.
*newpuid
NEWPUID command

Form:     NEWPUID  "TO/K"
Author:   IDW

   The NEWPUID command calls the ring NEWPUID service (located on AOTMAN),
to allocate a new user PUID.  If the TO keyword is given, then the new PUID
is written to the named file.  Otherwise the PUID is just printed out.

Examples:    NEWPUID
             NEWPUID  TO t:newpuid
*newsys
Form:           C NEWSYS  "LOAD/S"
Purpose:        To link a new TRIPOS system and possibly load it.
Author:         PB
Source:         :s.newsys

Availability:   *** Not available on the ring system ***

Specification:
   The system described in the file sys:sys.obj.system is linked
into the file file sys:sys.obj.tripos.
   If LOAD is specified then SYSLOAD is executed to load the new
system.
Example:        C SYSLOAD
                C SYSLOAD LOAD
*nil
*nil:
NIL: Device

The pseudo-device NIL: behaves as a sink for output or a source of ENDSTREAMCH
for input.
*note
NOTE Procedure

RESULT  := NOTE( SCB, VECTOR )

NOTE allows the current position of the file pointer in an open file to be
remembered.
SCB is the stream control block for the file (the result from FINDUPDATE).
VECTOR is a vector with upperbound at least 2 in which the file pointer is
       to be stored. The contents of this vector can be passed to a later
       call of POINT in order to set the file pointer back to the same place.
RESULT is zero if the call fails, non-zero if it succeeds.

Both NOTE and POINT are in the NOTE-POINT library (SYS:L.NOTE-POINT) which
should either be APPENDed to your program, or loaded with the LIBRARY command.

NOTE and POINT should be used with READWORDS and WRITEWORDS only. The effect
of using them with RDCH and WRCH is undefined.
*note-point
The NOTE-POINT library (SYS:L.NOTE-POINT) contains the routines NOTE and POINT,
together with versions of SELECTINPUT and SELECTOUTPUT suitable for use with
direct access files. It should either be APPENDed to your program, or loaded
with the LIBRARY command.
*nova
*nova2
The Data General NOVA2 computer attached to the ring, provides a magnetic
tape service in the form of the RTH Remote Tape Handler.  See HELP TAPE
and HELP TLS for help on using the Tape Server.
