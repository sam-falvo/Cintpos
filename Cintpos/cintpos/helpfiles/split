     The pseudo-device allows a single output stream to be sent to more than
one real output, for example, to send compiler error messages to both a file
and to the terminal:

     bcp source-file to object-file ver split:*+t:ver-file

     The split: name consists of an arbitrary number of sections, separated
by the + (plus) character.
     The stream appears to BLIB to be interactive; the individual substreams
are handled as appropriate. Hence, in the above example, lines will appear at
the terminal as soon as they are written, while normal buffering will appear
for the file stream.
