SET command
Form:           SET  "DIR,COMDIR/K"
Purpose:        To set a working directory and default command
                directory.
Author:         ARA (Modified by CGG)
Specification:
       SET alone causes the user's home directory to become the current
    working directory.
       DIR specifies a new working directory (i.e. one in which
    unqualified filenames are looked up).
       COMDIR specifies a default command directory (i.e. one in which
    commands should be sought when they are not found in the working
    directory).  The initial command directory is SYS:C.

    See also HELP REX SET for information on the REX SET Command.

Example:        SET
                SET :BRIAN
                SET DF1:T COMDIR DF1:C
