RDULTAPE command
Form:           "FILES,LRECL/A/K,BLKSIZE/A/K,BINARY/S"
Purpose:        To read unlabelled tapes in Fixed Block format
Author:         IDW

Specification:
    RDULTAPE is a program designed for reading unlabelled tapes, written
at installations other than Cambridge.  It uses the NOVA2 Tape Server,
and hence the tape must be written on 9 track tape at 800bpi.

    FILES       is the name of a file containing a list of files names into
                which the tape files will be copied.  If no FILES file is
                given, the default of the terminal is taken.

    LRECL       is a number, specifying the Logical RECord Length of the
                files to be read (in bytes).

    BLKSIZE     is a number, specifying the BLocKSIZE of the files to be
                read (in bytes).  BLKSIZE must be EVEN, and an integral
                multiple of LRECL.

    BINARY      is a switch which, if set, causes RDULTAPE to do no line
                imaging on the files as they are read.  If BINARY is not
                set, then RDULTAPE breaks the lines of the files at LRECL
                byte boundaries, and strips trailing blanks.

    N.B.  RDULTAPE does not refresh the dead man's handle in the Tape Server
          (see "The TRIPOS Tape Handler - IDW"), and so if an interactive
          session is chosen, care must be taken not to be idle for more than
          3 minutes, otherwise the tape server will time the session out.

Examples:

          RDULTAPE          LRECL=80   BLKSIZE=800
          RDULTAPE t:files  LRECL=132  BLKSIZE=2640  BINARY
