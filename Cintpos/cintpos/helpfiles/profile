PROFILE Command
Form:           PROFILE  "file/a"
Purpose:        To create and remove user's default assignments
Author:         MFR
Specification:

     This command is only relevent to the FM-TRIPOS system at the moment.
     The profile command has the form profile "file/a". The file contains
the information used to create and remove assignments. Each line in the file
should either be blank, or start with an asterisk (*), or be one of

     <ass-name>  <dir-name>|$  [<prot-bits>] [mc=<mctype>] [sys=<systype>]
     >           <file-name>

     FIRST CASE*
     If a line starts with an asterisk (*) then it will be ignored, and treated
as a comment.
     If $ is unsed instead of <dir-name>, then <prot-bits> must not be included,
if <dir-name> is used, then <prot-bits> must be set.
     <ass-name> is the name of the assignment, and may contain any characters,
except that the last, and only the last, must be a colon.
     <dir-name> is the name of a directory, in any normal form.
     <mctype> may be any machine type (currently either LSI4 or 68000)
     <systype> may be any system type (eg.,TRIPOS, FM-TRIPOS, AJW-TRIPOS)

     <prot-bits> can include two parts, separated by a slash (/) character.
The former part can include the access states R, W and D, and is used when
running the old protection system (usually with FSFH). The part after the
slash can contain any of CVXYZ, RWE, and DAU; these are used when running
with access matrices (but note that no check is made objects being files or
directories, so that making an assignment to a file, with say, CVX access,
could lead to bizare results!!!).
     Alternatively, <prot-bits> can be set to the character &, in which case
the new assignment will have the maximum permitted access.

     If <mctype> is given then the line is only obeyed on that type of machine.
     If <systype> is given then the line is only obeyed on that type of system.
     If <dir-name> is given, then the assignment must not previously exist; a
new one will be made, with the access limited to that specified by <prot-bits>.
The access may be further limited by the protection scheme. If $ is used, then
the assignment must already exist, and is cancelled.
     <ass-name> or <dir-name> may contain substitutions (cf., the C command)
which are any of:
     <mctype>   : substitutes machine type
                  will be either LSI4 or 68000 as appropriate
     <mcname>   : will substitute the machine ring name
     <mctype2>  : will substitute LSI4 or M68K as appropriate

     If there is a fault in a line then an error message will be written, and
the command will procede to the next line. The following is an example of a
profile file.

     B:    home:bcpl            RWD/CVXYZ
     C:    home:<mctype2>-c     R/Z
 *         only set up FM: on a 68000 machine running FM-TRIPOS
    FM:    home:dfs-fmfh        RWD/CVXYZ       mc=68000 sys=fm-tripos

    SECOND CASE:
    Profile files may be nested, up to ten levels deep, by using a line
starting with the > character. This will indirect to the file specified, and
will return at the end of that file. No specific check is made for recursion,
althouygh this would terminate on the tenth indirection. System and machine
type checking are not available with this option.
