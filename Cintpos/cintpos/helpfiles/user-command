USER command
Form:           USER  "PUID,AUTY,ALL/s,PRIVS/s,KILL=LOGOFF=DELETE/s"
Purpose:        To display and use the information in the FRIDGE.
Author:         CGG
Specification:
        Any (none or all) of the keywords
                [ALL | PRIVS | KILL]
        can be given.

        If none are given:
                The identity of the user is typed.  If his identity is not valid
                then an indication of this is given.

        PRIVS
                As well as the user's identification any other objects in the
                FRIDGE are listed.

        ALL
                Any objects listed are listed in full giving their PUID, AUTY,
                TUID and TPUID in hex.  Note that their TUIDs and TPUIDs are
                your proof that you a) are allowed to use the object and b) own
                the object, respectively.  If anyone were to see them at the
                terminal they could be copied and used.

        KILL = LOGOFF = DELETE
                The keywords PUID and AUTY can only be used with this keyword.
                If they are used then they specify a UID set in the Fridge which
                is to be deleted.  The PUID defaults to the user's own PUID and
                AUTY defaults to PRIVILEGE.  Only the first UID set with the
                specified PUID and authentity will be delete and an error given
                if none can be found.  If neither PUID or AUTY is given then
                all the objects in the FRIDGE are deleted, including the former
                user's identity.  The former user's identity is typed.

Examples:
        USER
        USER PRIVS
        USER ALL PRIVS
        USER ALL
        USER KILL
        USER DELETE aprivilege
        USER DELETE system auth
        USER KILL AUTY=auth
        USER ALL PRIVS LOGOFF
