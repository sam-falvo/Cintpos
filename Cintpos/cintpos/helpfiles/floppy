Using Floppy Discs from Tripos

There are two LSI4s in the processor bank with floppy disc drives. You can
use the machine attribute FLOPPIES to ask the Session manager for one.  E.g.

SM>  SYS TRIPOS MCATTR FLOPPIES

To mount a Tripos format floppy disc, use the MOUNT command:

MOUNT DF0:        [for drive 0; use DF1: for drive 1]

After the disc is mounted, files on it can be accessed as DF0:filename
Use the DISMOUNT command to dismount a disc.

Non-TRIPOS discs
----------------
It is possible to read 8" floppy discs in RT11 format on the processor bank.
BJK has a program to do this.

To read or write floppy discs in BBC micro or Torch CPN formats, use the
PHX terminal emulator, and the Tripos commands TOBBC and FROMBBC (q.v.).
