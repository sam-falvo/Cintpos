*occ
Form:           OCC  "FROM,TO,OPT,W/K"
Purpose:        To convert OCODE formats
Authors:        MJJ +PB

Specification:
      Reads FROM and writes TO. If text, the TO is W chars wide.
      OPT specifies the formats of the input and outputs, as single characters:

                B       Binary
                D       Default         (B for input, L for output)
                L       Literal
                N       Numeric
*ocode
OCODE is the intermediate code produced by the BCPL compiler.

The OCODE keyword to the BCPL and BCP commands enables OCODE to be written
to or read from a permanent file.

The command OCC exists for conversion between the various OCODE formats
*open
To open a file from BCPL use the procedures:
        findinput(file.name.string)  -  to open for input
        findoutput(file.name.string) -  to open for output
To subsequently close the currently selected input use:
        endread()                    -  to close input stream
        endwrite()                   -  to close output stream
Use HELP PROCEDURE <procedure> for futher information.

If a file has been left open it will not close until some time
after TRIPOS has stopped refreshing it a the FILESERVER.  (refreshing
is stopped by relinquishing the machine to the resource manager).
Files which are open can be deleted from their index using the
DELETE command (q.v.)
*device #H printer
*output
OUTPUT
      To identify the currently selected output stream.

            stream := output ()

   The output routine yields the identifier of  the  currently
selected output stream (originally yielded by a call of findoutput
(q.v.) and selected by selectoutput (q.v.)). If there is no current
output stream then the result will be zero.
*owner
Use the EX command with WHO option to discover the owner of a file.
