DU Command

Form:           du -[td] file ... [> file]
Purpose:        To give an idea of where all the disc space has gone
Author:         RSC
Specification:

        du descends a directory tree printing out the amount of space taken up
by the files in a directory in 1K units. The -t flag will mean that only the
total value is printed and the -d flag means that no subdirectories are
examined.

Examples:
        du home:


Bugs:
        The filing machine seems to have hicups every so often and sends the
names of the files in a directory twice.

        The program does not use RDARGS although "du ?" will produce a list of
the arguments available.

        The program does not check for looped directories...
