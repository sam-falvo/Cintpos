FROMPHX Command
Form:           FROMPHX  "FROM/A,TO/A,USER/A,PW/A"
Purpose:        To transfer files from Phoenix/MVT to TRIPOS
Author:         TJK
Specification:
        This command may be used to transfer files from Phoenix/MVT to TRIPOS.
    The syntax is

            fromphx FROM <phxfile> TO <file> USER <uid> PW <pw>

    which transfers the file called <phxfile> on Phoenix/MVT to a file called
    <file> on TRIPOS. A valid Phoenix userid and password must be quoted
    as <uid> and <pw>. The keywords FROM, TO, USER and PW are optional.
        The program monitors how many lines have been sent, and may be
    interrupted at any time by pressing CTRL/B. If Phoenix/MVT goes down, or
    something else goes wrong, the program will terminate but without the
    messsage "Transfer complete".  In this case simply try again.
**
The old FROMPHX command does not work with Phoenix/MVS (and is rather
unlikely to do so again)!  If you really want to know what it used to do
type HELP FROMPHX OLD.

To transfer a file from Phoenix now there are two routes:

 (i)   Use the CS FETCH command - see HELP on this

 (ii)  Use IDW's STREAM command on the 3081

To use stream, log on to Phoenix and go C IDW2.C:STREAM.  This takes
parameters FROM (PHX filename), TO (Tripos filename) and MC (a machine
running Tripos on the ring).  If the parameters are not given then they
will be prompted.  After typing the command, do not log off the Tripos
machine until two messages, indicating that the file transfer has started
and finished, have been issued.

Note that the STREAM facility can also be activated by submitting a job
using CS SUBMIT (q.v.).
