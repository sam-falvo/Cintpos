Purpose:        To physically copy a floppy disc.
Author:         PB
Specification:
   Similar to DISCCOPY, but for floppy discs.  The entire disc is
copied.
   CHECKBLOCKS causes a read-after-write check to be performed on
each block.

                DF-DISCCOPY DF0: TO DF2: CHECKBLOCKS

*disccopy
Form:           DISCCOPY  "FROM/A,TO/K"
Purpose:        To copy logical disc packs or bootstrap areas
                (physical copy).
Authors:        BJK PB
Specification:
   Use DISCCOPY <disc-area> TO <disc-area>
   <disc-area> specifies either a logical disc of the form
DP<unit>-<disc number>:  (e.g. DP1-3: is unit 1, logical disc 3) OR
a bootstrap area of the form DP<unit>-BOOT: .
   An area may not be copied to itself, nor may areas of different
type be copied.
Example:        DISCCOPY DP0-0: TO DP1-1:
                DISCCOPY DP0-BOOT: TO DP1-BOOT:
                DISCCOPY DK0: TO DK1:  [system with RK05 discs]
