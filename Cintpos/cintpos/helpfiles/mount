Form:           MOUNT "DEV/A,MODE,FROM/K"
Purpose:        To mount a device or pseudo-device.
Author:         MFR
Specification:
   The file "sys:info.mount" is search for the device name and the information
there used to control the mounting of the device.
   Mode can be used for such purposes as write protection. From gives a
file to be used instead of "sys:info.mount"
   The command may also be callseg'ed, in which case its argument should be a
string of the form "dev:". The default mode and mount files will be used, and
no error messages will be written (though result2 will be set). Note that
the global 'returncode' will be set, as stop(code) is used. The command will
try to run itself in a new coroutine to prevent stack overflows, and will
restore all globals (expect result2 and returncode).

Example:        MOUNT DF0: READ
                MOUNT DFS: UPDATE FROM SYS:MIKE.DFS-STUB.DFSINFO

   Note that for floppy discs written before about 1981, it will be necessary
to use 'mount df<n>: ver short' because of an incompatible disc format change.
