Z80LOAD command
Form:           Z80LOAD  "HEXIN/A,DEVICE/A,DEBUG,MAP/K,TRACE/K,MODULEINFO/K"
Purpose:        To load a Z80 on the Ring from Tripos
Author:         NJO
Specification:

     NOTE: this command has been superceeded by the GYPLOAD command for
           general use.  This command will not work if the target Z80
           is on another ring.

        The keyword HEXIN gives the file containing Cambridge Hex which
    is to be loaded.  The hex is loaded into the Z80 machine given by
    the DEVICE keyword.
        If a map of the areas into which the code has been loaded is
    needed then the file to which to write this information must be
    given using the MAP keyword.
        The debug service which is to be used ("<name>-debug") is given by
    the DEBUG keyword.  This will, by default, be the machine from which
    the code is loaded.
        The TRACE keyword is used to specify a file into which tracing
    information is written - it is used mainly for debugging the command.
        The MODULEINFO keyword may be used to specify a file into which
    information derived from control records in the hex (such as date
    and time of assembly, module name) will be written.

Examples:

        SYS:NICK.LIB.Z80LOAD z80prog proje2
        SYS:NICK.LIB.Z80LOAD bigprog z80machine MAP map-of-code
        SYS:NICK.LIB.Z80LOAD goodprog DEBUG=foxtrot myz80
