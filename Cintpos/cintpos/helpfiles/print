*COMMANDS
There is a variety of PRINT programs available on TRIPOS, including
              PRINT       -  the official one
              RINGPRINT   -  prints lists of files without buffering
              TYPE        -  official to screen
              TYP         -  interactive to the screen
              SCAN        -  prints selected part of file to screen
              TYPEHEX     -  prints binary file (in hex) to screen
Note that printer devices can be used as file names so that streams
can be opened straight to a given printer (see HELP PRINTER).  Thus simple
commands such as TYPE and COPY can be used to send files to a printer.
Use HELP <command> COMMAND for more information.
