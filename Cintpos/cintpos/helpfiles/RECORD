*record
Form:           RECORD  "TO,OFF/S,NOTIME/S"
Purpose:        To record a console session with timing information.
                The session can be played back by using the PLAYBACK
                command.

Specification:
   The RECORD command creates a task which acts as the console
output device.  It causes the console handler to send all its output
via this task, which sends it to the TO file as well as to the
console.  The file contains special characters representing timing
information.  The character #XFE indicates a delay of one clock
tick, and the pair '#XFF n' represents a delay of n ticks (0 <= n
<= 255).
   The OFF switch is used to finish a recording session.
   NOTIME causes the timing information to be omitted from the file.
Example:        RECORD RECORDING
                RECORD OFF
*playback
*back
Form:           PLAYBACK  "FROM/A,WAIT/S,NOTIME/S"
Purpose:        To play back a recording made by RECORD (q.v.).
Author:         RDE
Specification:
   FROM specifies the recording file.
   WAIT indicates that playback should start in "discontinuous" mode
(see "SPACE" below).
   NOTIME specifies that playback should start in "fast" mode (see
'f' and 's' below).
   During the playback, various characters can be used to control
the program:
   space    Force out the next character, and go into
            "discontinuous" mode:
            i.e. only output the next character when
            space or cr or esc is used.
   <cr>     Resume continuous mode
   <esc>    Resume continuous mode, but stop at end of line
   F        Enter "fast" mode, in which the timing information
            is ignored
   S        Resume "slow" mode
   Q        Quit
Example:        PLAYBACK RECORDING
*playfast
*fast
Form:           PLAYFAST  "FROM/A,TO/K"
Purpose:        To remove timing information from a file produced
                by RECORD (q.v.).
Author:         MR
Specification:
   It copies a recording file from FROM to TO, removing all timing
information and carriage returns.
Example:        PLATFAST RECORD-FILE TO LP:
*playtime
*time
Form:           PLAYTIME  "FROM/A"
Purpose:        To calculate the playback time of a recording made
                by RECORD (q.v.).
Author:         BJK
Specification:
   FROM specifies the recording file.
   The time that PLAYBACK would take to play back the file is printed.

Example:        PLAYTIME RECORDING
