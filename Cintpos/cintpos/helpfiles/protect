PROTECT command
Form:           PROTECT   "NAME/A,ACCESS"
Purpose:        To change the protection status of a file or directory.
Author:         BJK
Specification:
        This command enables the protection status of a file or directory to
    be altered.  The protection system provided at the moment is very simple
    and is only intended to allow a user to protect himself from his own
    mistakes.  The modes of access covered are read, write, and delete.
    NAME is the name of the file or directory.  ACCESS takes a string consisting
    of the letters R,W, and D indicating which modes of access are to be
    allowed.  (R = read access,  W = write access,  D = delete access).
        Files are created with access RWD, directories with RW.

        Use HELP ACCESS MATRIX for information about the access matrices
    that are used on the filing system provided by the filing machine.
    The relevent command for use with that filing system is the ALTER
    command (use HELP ALTER COMMAND for further details).

Example:
        PROTECT MYFILE RW
        PROTECT olddir D
