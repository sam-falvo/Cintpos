Purpose:        To print out infomration about who is using processor bank
                machines, where they are, and what they are running.

Author:         MAJ

Specification:

   WHO prints out information obtained from the resource manager and filing
machine about the use of machines in the processor bank.


   The following options control WHICH machines information is printed about:

        unkeyed         Up to ten specific machine names may be given as
                        positional parameters. Only these machines will be
                        selected.
        ALL             All machines known to the resource manager will be
                        selected.
        ALLOC           All 'allocated' machines will be selected.

   At most one of the above three selections may be given. If none is given,
the default is to choose allocated machines and withdrawn machines which are
running something.


   The following options control WHAT is printed about each selected machine:

        WHO             The user's name (or PUID if it cannot be translated
                        into a name).
        WHAT            The name of the system running in the machine.
        WHERE           The owning terminal or machine and its location.
        STATE           The resource manager state of the machine.
        FULL            All of the above information.

   The default is equivalent to "WHO WHERE".  Under some circumstances the
resource manager state will be printed even if it was not explicitly requested;
this indicates that the state is such that the other information would not
be relevant.

   The following option is for debugging use only:

        TRACE           Set the value of the internal trace mask.


Warning:

   WHO is examining a world which may be changing under its feet.  There can
be no guarantee that the information printed represents the state of the
world at any instant.
