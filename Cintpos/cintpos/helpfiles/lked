LKED command
Form:           "FROM=ROOT,TO/K,WITH/K,VER/K,LIBRARY/K,*
                *RESIDENT/K,MAP/K,XREF/K,WIDTH/K,ADDRINC/K"
Purpose:        To link together TRIPOS binary files.
Author:         RDE
Specification:
      LKED [[FROM | ROOT] files] [TO file] [WITH files]
           [VER file] [LIBRARY files] [RESIDENT files]
           [MAP file] [XREF file] [WIDTH n] [ADDRINC n]

           In the above, 'file' means a single TRIPOS file
      name, 'files' means zero or more file names, separated
      by comma, plus or space, and 'n' is an integer.
           Note that if file names are separated by spaces
      in the command line, the parameter must be enclosed in
      quotes, as in the example below.
           In the cases where a list of files can be given,
      the files are read in the order specified, as if they
      had been concatenated.
           The parameters have the following meanings:
      FROM or ROOT: This specifies the object files to be
                    used as the primary binary input.  The
                    contents of these files are always copied
                    to the load file, and form part of the
                    overlay root.
      TO:           This specifies the destination for the
                    load file.  If this parameter is not
                    given, the second pass is omitted.
      WITH:         This specifies files containing LKED
                    parameters.  Usually only one file will
                    be used here, but, for completeness, a
                    list of files can be given.  Note that
                    parameters on the command line will
                    override those in WITH files.  The syntax
                    of these files is described fully in
                    II.2 of the spec.
      VER:          This specifies the destination of LKED
                    messages.  If not specified, all messages
                    are output to the initially selected
                    stream.
      LIBRARY:      This specifies the files to be scanned
                    as the library.  Only hunks that contain
                    definitions of symbols that have been
                    referenced, but not previously defined,
                    will be output.
      RESIDENT:     This specifies the files used as the
                    resident library.  These files are only
                    scanned once, to find symbol definitions,
                    and are not output to the load file.
                    When the linked program is run, the
                    resident library should have been loaded
                    with the LIBRARY command.  (Appendix C).
      MAP:          This specifies the destination of the
                    link map.
      XREF:         This specifies the destination of the
                    cross reference output.
      WIDTH:        This specifies the output width to be
                    used when producing the link map and
                    cross reference table.  This parameter is
                    provided to enable output to be send to a
                    printer or to a narrower terminal,
                    without wasting paper in one case, or
                    making the output unreadable in the
                    other.
      ADDRINC:      This specifies the address increment
                    (1 for a word-addressed machine, 2 for a
                    byte-addressed one) of the machine that
                    will run the load file produced by LKED.
                    The value, which must be 1 or 2, is only
                    used when generating COMMON blocks.  Its
                    default value is the addres increment of
                    the machine running LKED.  Thus ADDRINC
                    need only be quoted when cross-linking a
                    program with COMMON blocks for a machine
                    with a different address increment.

        For a complete specification see TRIPOS.PRINT.LKEDSPEC on Phoenix.

Examples:
        The note-point library must be loaded before using LKED - use:
        LIBRARY :L.NOTE-POINT

        Examples of valid uses of LKED:

      LKED a
      LKED FROM "a b c d" TO bin.abcd ADDRINC 2
      LKED ROOT a+b+c+d MAP map-file WIDTH 120
      LKED a,b,c TO output LIBRARY :a68c.lib.mod,obj.newlib
