*CALLSEG
RSEND may be called on a CALLSEG in :L.RSEND
The aguments are (mode, vector).

Mode should be 2 for a vector of the form
        "To", file, "Subject", "immediate data", "cc", "bcc", "replyto", bits
Any omitted item should be Zero.  [File may either be a string or a PUID]
If a file is given IT MUST NOT BE CHANGED as it PUID is passed over, NOT its
contents!!

Form:           RSEND   User=users=initials/a,FROM/k,TERM/k,ABOUT/k,immed/k,*
                        *CC/k,BCC/k
Purpose:        To send people mail via the ring
Authors:        PB

Specification:
               Mail is sent to all the people mentioned in the user lists USER,
        CC and BCC, the only difference being whether or where the names appear
        in the mail header.     A user list is a set of initials seperated by
        commas.

                If a file is given as FROM then the PUID of that file is passed
        to the mail system for delivery to the recipients.      The file is
        logically immuteable, i.e. cannot be changed.   This will be enforced
        by the mailserver when the fileserver supports such files.
        Note that the FROM argument must be a FILE, not NIL: etc..
        Immed specifies the immediate data that is to form the file. This cannot
        be used with FROM (or TERM as TERM implies FROM or 'read input stream').
        Note that the ammount of data that can be entered in this manner is
        limited, as the whole SSP block must be less than 256 ring words.
        Otherwise the current input stream is read until a line of just the
        string TERM is found (default of '/*') or a pseudo endofstream (@Q),
        and the result put into a workfile, which is passed to the mailserver.
        If the input stream is immediately closed, then no file is created.

                The ABOUT argument is passed over as the SUBJECT of the mail.
        Note that if it is to include spaces, it must be in quotes (".. ..").

                The MAP service is called to check that each user exists.

                See HELP RING MAIL for an introduction.

Form:           RMessage        User=users=initials,to,opt/K
Purpose:        To receive mail via the ring
Authors:        PB

Specification:
                This command is an attempt to have a compatible interface with
        the standard TRIPOS message system, and as such utilises few of the
        capabilities of the system.

                USER is a user list, which is carefully checked to ensure that
        only the current user is actually mentioned, as you cannot look at other
        people's mail.

                TO is an output file for the Mail

                OPT is a string of SINGLE characters indicating what is to be
        done.  I'm afraid I don't really understand the way they work, but I
        have tried to emulate it:

                D       Delete  all mail
                E       Extract all mail (=RD)
                I       Init    = Quiet
                M       ????    Edit messages
                R       Read    all mail
                Q       Quiet   Do nothing if there is no mail
                T       Test    for NEW mail only - do not read it
                S       Summarize all the mail

        The default is R is USER is specified, otherwise E.
        SR gives a close approximation to MESSAGEs R.
        Note that Q implies T !!

                The preferred command is RMAIL

                See HELP RINGMAIL for an introduction.

Purpose:        To receive mail via the ring
Author:         PB

Specification:
                TO is an output file for the Mail

                The switches are

         /      Read            all mail        \       Any
        <       Delete          all mail         >      combination
         \      Summarize       all the mail    /       allowed
                All             Look at ALL mail, even that marked for deletion
                Interactive     Prompt the user for each mail item
                Test            Only test whether there is (new) mail
                Quiet           Do nothing if there is no mail
                Tripos          Look at TRIPOS's mail
                New             Look only at new (actually unread) mail

                QUIET   can be used with any other combination.
                ALL and INTERACTIVE can be used with anything but TEST
                TEST    can ONLY be used with QUIET, READ and/or NEW.
                        TEST alone means        'Test for new mail'
                        TEST READ  means        'Test for any mail'

                READ            means type all messages in full
                SUMMARIZE       means type the header in brief format
                READ SUMMARIZE  means type the header in brief, the text in full

                INTERACTIVE     prints the header of the current message, and
                                expects an operation. Use ? to find the options.

                No option at all maps into INTERACTIVE.

                If non-interactive deletes are performed, then a copy is sent to
                the file t:mail.

                An init-sequence may include RMAIL READ NEW QUIET

TEST.MAIL
=========

This is the vehicle for testing new ideas, and users are advised to try it.
This documentation may be out of date.  The most recent changes are available
by typing HELP NEW, HELP TESTING and HELP FULLSCREEN while in TEST.MAIL.

Current differences from MAIL are:

                It runs throughout in single character mode.  This overcomes a
                terminal concentrator bug whereby a single output record may be
                interupted by input.  It also allows proper use of the cursor
                keys - in particular, when a command is expected, the UP & DOWN
                keys may be used to select a new current message. This only
                works at the start of a command line - once it has started
                reading a command, only data characters or RETURN may be entered

                The terminal concentrators escape sequences are not supported -
                the operations supported are
                        'delete char to left of cursor'         DEL
                        'delete current line'                   CAN = CTRL/X


SEND/REPLY      allow 'full screen' input.  This is NOT intended to be an editor
                All it allows is simple corrections to spelling mistakes.
                See HELP FULLSCREEN within TEST.MAIL.

                REPLY takes note of the REPLY TO field of the header

                Also more flexible file handling. Keyword FILE passes the PUID
                of that file, FROM or STREAM copies the stream, and switch
                NONE tells the program not to use the current input.
                The user is prompted for source if no keyword is given.

headers:        The header for each message now indicates whether it has been
                TYPEd. On cifer2632s, if an item HAS been typed, then the date,
                time, sender and size of files are half intensity. On other
                terminals, the letter 'n' appears before the time if it has NOT
                been typed.

Selection:      The first untyped message is selected, if there is one.
                Otherwise message 0.
                The cursor keys also allow selection.

RECEIVING RING MAIL
    Two commands are available for receiving Ring Mail - one which is designed
to be similar to the MESSAGE command (use HELP MESSAGE COMMAND) called
RMESSAGE (use HELP RMESSAGE COMMAND) and the recommended command which is
called RMAIL (use HELP RMAIL COMMAND).  There is also the MAIL command.
*system
*SYSDESC
To use the mailserver TRIPOS system, get a Session Manager stream, and ask for
                SYSDESC MAILSERVER
This will prompt you for your Userid and password, and then await commands.
HELP will tell you what you can do.

See HELP RINGMAIL for an introduction.
*ringmail
*command
**
        The Ring message system currently has Two Tripos interfaces.
        One has been contorted to look like the current message system,
        (See HELP RING SEND     &       HELP RING MESSAGE, HELP RING RMAIL)
        the other runs in its own TRIPOS image, with a SYSDESC of MAILSERVER,
        Or as a command
        (See HELP RINGMAIL SYSTEM       &       HELP MAIL)

        It uses the ring service MAIL to maintain USER MAIL DIRECTORIES.
        The MAIL service will accept a fileserver puid and a list of user puids,
        and mail the file to the users. It authenticates the sender.
        It also gives an authenticated user the file server puid of his user
        mail directory which contains all the mail for that user.
        The mail files themselves are (logically) immuteable, but the user's
        mail directory is a normal file -- if you damage yours, then the MAIL
        service is likely to discard your old one and make a new one.

        The hard work is done by demons that are started by the MAIL service
        when it has received a new mail item, or feels that there is a lot of
        dead mail.      Note that this means that while all the machines are in
        use, mail cannot be posted to the recipients.
