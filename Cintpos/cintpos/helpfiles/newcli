Form:           NEWCLI  "DEV"
Purpose:        To create a new interactive CLI task.
Author:         ARA
Specification:
        The new CLI task has the same set directory and prompt string as
     the one in which NEWCLI is executed.  It announces its task number
     as it starts up.
        By default, the new CLI uses the same terminal as the one from
     which it was created.  The DEV argument allows a different terminal
     device to be specified.
        Note that a new CLI can also be obtained from the console handler
     by using the 'X' reply to a break (use HELP TERMINAL CONCENTRATOR
     BREAK for more information).

     In order to select which task you wish to talk to when you have several
     interactive CLI tasks, type <Control-S> nn   where 'nn' is the two-digit
     task number of the required task. <Control-S> will be reflected as '@S'.

Example:        NEWCLI
