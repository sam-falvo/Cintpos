AOT PROCEDURES
    There are a number of files in which procedures to call different AOT
entries have been written - they are available in :G.BCPL and rely upon
the RSX ring library (also in :G.BCPL).
    Use HELP SOURCELIB AOT for a full list.

AOT RCS
    Each entry returns a 16-bit SSP return code.  These return codes
are either specific to AOT or from the global set.  (Use HELP RING RCS
for their interpretation).

    General RCs:
        E004   -   internal error (e.g. full)
        C00B   -   unexpected size of request block
        C040   -   bad entry number
        A004   -   temporarily not available (during a file server
                   interaction)

    AOT specific RCs:
        DFD0  -  invalid UID set
        DFD1  -  bad TUID (bad format or does not exist)
        DFD2  -  illegal PUID given
        DFD3  -  bad TPUID
        DFD5  -  illegal timeout specified
        DFD6  -  authorization failed (bad AUTY UID set)
        DFD9  -  bad size of request block
        FFDA  -  internal error, tables full
