Form:           SKIP  "LABEL"
Purpose:        To perform a jump in a command sequence.
Author:         CGG
Specification:
   SKIP is used in conjunction with LAB (try HELP LAB COMMAND).
   It can be used either with or without a label; without one, it
finds the first unnamed LAB command.  LAB must be the first item on
a line of the file.
   SKIP will only jump forwards in the command sequence.
   Labels are not local to command files.
Example:        SKIP
                SKIP ERRORLAB
