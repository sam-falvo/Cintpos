GIVEFILE command
Form:           GIVEFILE   "FROM/A,TO=MACHINE,AS/A,BINARY/S,NOTAUTH/S"
Purpose:        To send a file to another machine.
Author:         BJK
Specification:
        FROM    - the name of the file to be transferred
        TO      - the name of the machine to which the file is to be transferred
        AS      - the name of the file on machine <TO> in which to put the
                  transferred file
        BINARY  - this must be quoted if the file to be transferred is not text
        NOTAUTH - normally AUTHBSP: will be used to make the transfer, this
                  will include proof of the user's identity at the beginning of
                  transfer so that full access may be allowed to the user's file
                  space on the remote machine.  Quoting this switch will use
                  BSP: for the transfer which does not include the user's
                  identity.  For use with "untrusted" remote machines or with
                  those that have not implemented AUTHBSP.
