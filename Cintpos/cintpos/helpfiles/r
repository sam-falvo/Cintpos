*rainbow
The RAINBOW is a high resolution graphics workstation developed at Cambridge.
See a member of the RAINBOW research group, or Dr. N.E. Wiseman for further
information.
*ram
Use the MAP command to find out how much memory is available and how much
is currently in use.
*range #H #HCH %
%syntax #H scan
*rats
RATS stands for Remotely Activated Terminal Session.  It is the prefix
conventionally applied to the service names of Cambridge virtual terminal
protocol services, e.g. "RATS-PHOENIX" to access phoenix.  The terminal
concentrator adds this prefix by default to names it is given.  Its reverse
is STAR, which is the name of the TRIPOS command which makes connections.
*rdch
RDCH
      To read the next character from the currently selected
input stream.
      ch := rdch ()
      A call of rdch yields the next sequential character of
the currently selected input stream, unless that  stream  is
exhausted,  in which case the end-of-stream character ( end-
streamch ) is returned.
*reader
READER is a ring service analagous to WRITER, which enables files to be
read remotely from other TRIPOS machines.  It bipasses all forms of
authentication, and hence should be used with care.

    copy bsp:read-black/:idw.fred to t:fred

will copy the file ":idw.fred" on machine "black" into a local file.
*readhex
Form:           READHEX  "FROM/A,TO/A"
Purpose:        To convert a file of hexadecimal numbers to binary
Author:         ??
Specification:

   Undoes TYPEHEX.
*readmail  #H  triposmail
*readvec #H readwords
*reason
Use the WHY command to find the reason that the last command failed,
or the FAULT command or procedure to convert a fault code into text.
*reboot
*recover
*reload
*restart
*restarting
To reboot a processor bank machine, connect to the Session Manager and type:

SYS system MCNAME name

where 'system' is the name of the system you want loaded (e.g. TRIPOS), and
      'name'   is the machine name (e.g. BROWN)

You can load a machine by name only if it is allocated to you already (or
withdrawn).  If a machine crashes, you will usually have 5 minutes before
the Resource Manager reclaims it.
*reflection #H reflect
*reflexion #H reflect
*relocation
See HELP LKED ALL for details of object module format, including the way
relocation information is stored.
*remote-debug
A version of DEBUG which enables one 68000 to be debugged from another is
available in "idw:68000-obj.remote-debug".
*rename
Form:           RENAME  "FROM/A,TO=AS/A"
Purpose:        To rename a file.
Author:         PB
Specification:
   The FROM file is renamed with the TO name.  FROM and TO must be
filenames on the same disc.
Example:        RENAME ABC AS DEF
*renameobj
RENAMEOBJ

  RENAMEOBJ is the BLIB routine for renaming a file or directory.  The
form is:

    RESULT := RENAMEOBJ( fromname, toname )

where both arguments are strings.

  RESULT is non-zero if the rename succeeds, and zero (with a fault code in
RESULT2) if it fails.  Note that renaming is allowed only if both names
refer to the same device.  In Fileserver filing systems, renaming will fail
if the two names refer to different fileserver packs.
*repair
To report faults in equipment maintained by the Computer Laboratory, use the
REPAIR command on Phoenix.  Otherwise try a message to "tripos-manager".
*result2 #H rc
*returnpkt
RETURNPKT
      To return a packet to its sender.
      res := returnpkt ( pkt, res1, res2 )
      The res1 and res2 values are set into the pkt.res1 and
pkt.res2 fields of the packet, and the  packet  then  trans-
mitted using the qpkt primitive.  The result of returnpkt is
the result of the call of qpkt.
*reverse #H #HCH %
*revtrace #H #HCH %
%trace
%revtrace
See HELP SOURCELIB REVTRACE for details of a routine to perform a nameserver
'reverse trace' call.
%connection
A "reverse connection" in Cambridge virtual terminal protocol is when a
host makes a connection to a terminal handler (usually the terminal handler
initiates the connection).  See HELP VTP for general info on VTP.

Rex-Tripos is the name of the version of Tripos which uses the Rex Shell
as its main CLI.  On 68000s, this is the default version, and is called
simply "Tripos".

The Tripos RMCOMMAND command provides an SSP interface to the Resource

SYS:SYS.RESMAN.<mctype>-OBJ.  Please note that this command is NOT for
general use, and should only be executed by system managers, or people
that really know what they are doing.
*rmvthand #H terminal
*rmvthan #H terminal
*roff
ROFF PAGINATOR

The ROFF paginator is not available under TRIPOS.  It is still available
on CAP and RSX.  For new documents use GCAL on Tripos or the IBM, or TeX
on Unix.
*room #H #HCH %
%titan
TITAN ROOM

The Titan Room is room 203 in the Arup building (which has access via
Corn Exchange Street and the New Museum Site).  It is named after the famous
computer that resided there from 1963 - 1973.  In general only research
staff and students are allowed access to the Titan Room, although others
are sometimes allowed temporary access (a list of such people can normally
be found on the door).

The Titan Room houses a large number of computers, notably the Computing
Service's VAX, the CAP and the Processor Bank.  It also contains the
Titan Room line printer and the Canon laser printer.  Documentation is kept
there in the Documentation Drawer and on various shelves - on one of which
the Documentation Folder can be found.
