*SERVER
The ring NOVA2 computer runs the RTH (Remote Tape Handler) Tape Server
program.  It provides a simple interface to its 800 bpi tape drive,
enabling both labelled and unlabelled tapes to be read and written.

The server machine is physically located near the back left hand corner
of the Titan room, and the tape racks are behind it.

For further information, see:

*DEVICE
Tapes are available from TRIPOS via the MT: device.  The tape drive used
is connected to the NOVA2 computer, which runs the RTH (remote tape handler)
Tape Server program.  Tape file names are of the form  MT:<name>/<seq>, where
<name> is a TRIPOS type file-name (of up to 17 characters), and <seq> is the
sequence number of the file on the tape.

Examples:

(Mounting a tape)
                      MOUNT MT:IDW001
                      MOUNT MT:WOMBAT
(Dismounting a tape)
                      DISMOUNT MT:
(Using tape files)
                      COPY :G.LIBHDR TO MT:LIBHDR/1
                      TYPE MT:ERIC-WAS-HERE/5
                      MT:ECHO/56 "This is a string"
                      EX MT:
                      EX MT:ARTICHOKE/8
*NEW
*INIT
*INITIALISE
A tape must be initialised before it can be mounted as the MT: device.
To do this, a special program must be run locally to the tape server
machine.  See the instructions on the side of the tape server.

After this, if the tape is to be used with TLS, it must be initialised
for TLS.  This is done remotely using the INIT parameter of TLS.  See
HELP TLS for details.
