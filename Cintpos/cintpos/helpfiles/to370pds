NEW.TO370PDS Command
Form:           "FILES/A,TO/A,USER/A,PW/A,JD/K"
Purpose:        To send a list of files to a 370 PDS.
Author:         IDW
Specification:
        Transfers the files listed (one per line) in the file given by
    FILES to the PDS on the IBM given by TO.  The filespace to be used
    is given by USER and the relevent password must be supplied using
    PW.
        The FILES file must contain a list of lines which satisfy the string
    "TRIPOSFILE/A,AS", where TRIPOSFILE is the Tripos file name, and the
    optional AS part is the 370 PDS member name.  This defaults to the
    Tripos file name if it is omitted.  If FILES is * (the terminal) the
    files will be prompted for.
        The default JD parameters can be changed by quoting the JD
    keyword.  The default of 200K LIMSTORE and 5 seconds COMP should
    be enough for most applications.  The size of the TO file can be
    increased on creation by adding phoenix qualifiers.

Examples:
        NEW.TO370PDS myfiles .myfiles idw2 PW password
        NEW.TO370PDS myfiles .myfiles/trk20,5,10 idw2 PW password JD "comp 10"
