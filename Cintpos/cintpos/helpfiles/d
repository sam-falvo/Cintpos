DEBUG68 provides a friendly environment for running small 68000 machine code
programs.  Documentation can be found in the file IDW2.SPEC.DEBUG68 on Phoenix.
*delay
DELAY
     To cause a task to be delayed for a given time.
     res := delay ( ticks )
     A packet is sent  to  the  timer  with  the  specified number of ticks.
     The result is the value of the pkt.res1 field of the packet when it returns
from the timer, and the result2 global will be set to the pkt.res2 value.

DELETEDEV   Procedure to delete a device.

        DCB := DELETEDEV(DEVID)

Argument:  DEVID   The id. of the device to be deleted.

Normal return:  DCB\=0
                  The specified device has been successfully deleted.

Error return:   RESULT=0
                  Possible errors are:
                    RESULT2=101, Invalid id.
                    RESULT2=107, Work queue not empty.
Side effect:
   The device entry will be  removed  from  the  device table.

Related routine:   CREATEDEV

Notes:
   The device work queue must be empty.
   The DCB is not FREEVEC'ed.

DELETEOBJ

  A procedure in BLIB for deleting a filing system file or directory:
  (also called DELETEFILE on some implementations)

  RESULT := DELETEOBJ(NAME)

  NAME is a string giving the name of the object to be deleted.

  RESULT \= 0 indicates that deletion was successful
  RESULT = 0  means that deletion failed. Error code in RESULT2.

DEPLETE Procedure

DEPLETE is an internal BLIB routine called by WRCH when it has a buffer of
characters to write out.
*derail
DERAIL is program which runs under Phoenix to convert ASCII files to EBCDIC.
Some file transfer commands (e.g. CS INPUT) invoke DERAIL at the Phoenix
end.

See RSX.SPEC:DERAIL on Phoenix for details.
*devicetask
DEVICETASK procedure

TASKID  := DEVICETASK(NAME)

Find the handler task for a given stream device.

NAME should be a string of the form "device:" or "device:pathname".
The name is looked up in the system assignments list.

TASKID is set to the id of the handler task for "device:", or to zero if
the name is not known. RESULT2 is set to point to the directory lock if
"device:" is an assignment to a directory rather than a whole device, otherwise
it is set to zero.

The ASSIGN command may be used to set up logical assigned names for tasks and
directories, and to see what assigned names currently exist.

There is no device DIR:.  Perhaps you want the EX: device, which produces
a readable stream similar to the output of EXAMINE.  See HELP on this.

*dismount
Form:           DISMOUNT "DEV/A,FROM/K"
Purpose:        To dismount a device or pseudo-device.
Author:         MFR
Specification:
   An attempt will be made to dismount the given device. See HELP MOUNT
for more information about the parameters.
   For a full description of the mount system try HELP MOUNT ALL
Example:        DISMOUNT MT1:
*distribution #H #HCH %
%list #H triposmail
%*
There is no general help on distribution, even though distributed computing
is what a lot of us are here for!  If you're just after MAIL distribution list
handling, try HELP MAIL LIST.

*dle
DLE stands for Data Link Escape (character Control-P), which is used to
give control commands to a termal connection.  For example:

    CTRL-P E                Switches off reflection
    CTRL-P T                Causes transmission of any buffered characters
    CTRL-P <control char>   Causes <control char> to pass through uninterpreted

So, to send Control-S to a Tripos session from the UDN, type:

    CTRL-P CTRL-S CTRL-P T
*dns
DNS was a "dynamic nameserver" service in which names could be registered,
looked up, deleted etc.  It is described in M. Yudkin's thesis.  The service
has now been withdrawn.
