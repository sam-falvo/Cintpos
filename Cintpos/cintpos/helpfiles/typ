Form:           Typ  "FILE/A,STOP,)/S,FROM=START=(,TO/K,LN,NOLN,*
                      *W=WIDTH/K,P=PAGELENGTH/K"
Purpose:        To type a file
Author:         PBr

Specification:
  Typ types selected lines of the file.  To type lines n to m, format may be:
  m   or    (n m)    or    ( n m )    or   m n
  m should be greater than n.
  n defaults to 1 and m to maxint.
  If NOLN is specified, line numbers are not added.
  If LN is specified, line numbers are added.
  The program types <PAGELENGTH> of text and then waits for input,
    unless a TO file is specified.  Q or W (or CNTRL-z) stop the typing. L makes
    it continuous.  <number> causes <number> lines to be printed before
    the next halt.
  Pagelength and width default to 22 and 80 unless the terminal type has been
    set, when pagelength is set to the terminal depth -1.
  Ctrl/B will cause it to stop at the next convenient point.
  Typing any character causes pagewaiting EXCEPT those mentioned above, and
    (return) causes the number of lines left to be typed to be reset to
    pagelength.  While pagewaiting, any character EXCEPT (space) cause
    continuation.  For more information on command line syntax use
