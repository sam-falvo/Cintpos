STATUS command
Form:           STATUS  "TASK,FULL/S,SEGS/S,TCB/S,CLI=ALL/S"
Purpose:        To print information about the tasks currently in
                existence.
Author:         BJK
Specification:
       STATUS alone lists the numbers of the tasks, indicating whether
    each is waiting, suspended, running, interrupted, held and/or
    broken, and whether its work queue is empty.
       TASK specifies a task number: only information about that task is
    produced.  Otherwise information is printed about all tasks.
       FULL = SEGS + TCB + CLI
       SEGS prints the names of the BCPL sections on each task's segment
    list.
       TCB prints information about the priority, stacksize, and global
    vector size of each task.
       CLI identifies Command Language Interpreter tasks, and prints the
    section name(s) of the currently loaded command (if any).
       By default the CLI option is taken as specified.

Example:        STATUS
                STATUS 4 FULL
                STATUS TCB
