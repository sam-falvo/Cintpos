TO370 command
Form:           TO370  "FROM/A,TO/A,USER/A,PW/A,PROJECT/K,*
                       *ROUTE/K,COMP/K,LIMSTORE/K,JD/K"
Purpose:        To send TRIPOS files to the IBM370
Author:         TJK
Warning:        *** The CS command is a preferred alternative ***
Specification:
        This command transfers files from TRIPOS to the IBM370. The syntax is
    similar to FROM370:

        to370 FROM <file> TO <370file> USER <uid> PW <pw>

    where the keywords FROM, TO, USER and PW are all optional.
    The file is sent by constructing a job, which is sent to the 370 in
    the same way as any normal job is submitted. A line will be printed at
    the end of the job submission indicating failure, or the priority and
    turnround if it worked. Occasionally further messages may be given such
    as when the next dedicated period is scheduled.
        A number of other parameters may be given, but defaults are provided
    if they are not. These parameters are as follows:
            PROJECT     Project number, default *
            ROUTE       Route, default RECEPTION
            COMP        Time limit, default 5 seconds
            LIMSTORE    Store requested, default 20K
            JD          Default SAVE.
        The JD keyword may be used to set other Job Description options
    such as TURNROUND, etc.

    If the transfer succeeds, then the job output is rerouted to dummy
    and the job released, so the job output is kept only if something
    goes wrong.
Example:

    TO370 fred tjk1.fred tjk1 PW secret JD "Turnround overnight"

        will send the TRIPOS file "fred" to the 370 as "tjk1.fred", using
        userid tjk1 and password as shown. The job has requested turnround
        of "overnight".  Note the use of quotation marks around the value quoted
        as argument to JD, because the value contains a space.
