MAP COMMAND

Form:     MAP  "BLOCKS/S,NAMES/S,CODE/S,MAPSTORE/S,TO/K,PIC/S"
Purpose:  To print information about store allocation

Specification:
*command ..
   MAP alone indicates the total amount of store in the store chain, the
size of the largest contiguous free chunk and the total amounts allocated
and free.

   BLOCKS gives the size and address of every block.

   NAMES gives the total space taken up by routine and section names.
*command ..
*code

   CODE gives the name, address and length of each loaded code section.
*command ..
*mapstore

   MAPSTORE gives the  name and address of every routine, and prints any
profile counts found in the code.
*command ..

   TO can be used to specify an output file.
*command ..
*pic

   PIC gives  the allocation  map as a  picture. Each  character printed
represents a small number of words of store (the exact number depends on
the total memory size). '.' means they are free, '@' that they are completely
allocated, and 'a' that they are partially allocated.
*command

Examples: MAP
          MAP PIC
*idmap
Form:           IDMAP  "BLOCKS/S,NAMES/S,CODE/S,MAPSTORE/S,TO/K,PIC/S"
Purpose:        To provide information about store allocation.
Author:         BJK

Specification:

   Similar to MAP, except that the BLOCKS option is the default, and
IDVEC is invoked to try to identify each allocated block.

Example:        IDMAP
*service ..
The MAPNAME command can be used to access the Ring Map Service.

MAPNAME command

Form:           MAPNAME user,to,from
Purpose:        Map between names
Author:         PB

Specification:

   A program to call the service MAP to convert a name from one domain to
another.  The domains are PUID, PNAME, WORLD, INITIALS, CAP, RSX, 370,
LOCATION, TERMTYPE, TERMINFO and INTERFACE.

   There is also a library routine to do this from a program.  See
HELP SOURCELIB MAPNAME for more information.

   Terminfo is a set of strings seperated by commas, each consisting of
a number followed by letters indicating the value concerned.  Thus
"19200b,32d,80l" means a 19k2 baud line with a screen that is 32 lines
deep, and 80 characters long.

   Interface describes the ring interface for a particular machine.

   The FROM domain may also be ANY which looks in all domains.  WARNING:
this MAY be ambiguous!

USER    defaults to the PUID of the current user.
TO      defaults to world
FROM    defaults to ANY (unless no USER is given)

Examples

        MAPNAME
        MAPNAME pb
        MAPNAME pb puid

The following mapping programs exist:

   MAP     gives info about your machine's store - type COMMAND for more info
   IDMAP   gives more detailed info than MAP - type IDMAP for more info
   MAPNAME does mappings between naming domains - type MAPNAME for more info

There are also user-callable routines MAP and MAPNAME in SOURCELIB.  Type
SOURCELIB MAP or MAPNAME for more info.
