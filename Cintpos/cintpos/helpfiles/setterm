SETTERM command
Form:           SETTERM "type,width/k,depth/k,ring/s,clear/s,verify/s"
Purpose:        To set, clear or display the terminal type.
Author:         MAJ
Specification:

        The first argument is the terminal type to be set, but if the RING
    switch is given the program will attempt to find the terminal type from
    the ring MAP service, and only use the first argument if that fails.
        The WIDTH and DEPTH argument give overriding values for terminal
    width and depth (normally these default to appropriate values for the
    terminal type).
        The CLEAR switch causes the terminal type information to be cleared
    before further processing of the arguments. The VERIFY switch causes
    the state to be verified after processing.
        If no arguments are given, a list of valid terminal types is given and
    the current state is verified.

        Use HELP <command name> COMMAND TERMINAL to find the terminal types
    that any particular command can use (if HELP knows).
        (Uses Global 157 of consolehandler to point to a vector containing
    the terminal type as a number and as a string, and the width and depth.
    See :G.termhdr for more details).
