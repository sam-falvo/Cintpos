*commands #I #HCH=+ #FULL
There are two main EXamine commands on TRIPOS.  The usual one is EX which
types the status of each file or directory in a given directory. IEX examines
a directory interactively. The EXALL command has been withdrawn; the "all"
option to EX should be used (see HELP EX).
   For information about IEX type IEX and for EX type EX. Type <CR> to leave
HELP.

EX command
Form:           EX  "object=dir,quick=q/s,dates/s,nodates/s,keys/s,since/k,*
                    *upto/k,to/k,p=pat/k,s/k,slots/k,all/s,who/s,for/k,raw/s"

Purpose:        To examine a directory or tree of directories
Authors:        MFR

Specification:
   EX     <dir> examines a directory, sending output to the current output
                stream.

   TO    <file> can be used to specify an output file.
   KEYS         prints the disc key of the object. For fileserver based systems,
                this will be all or part of the (file) PUID.
   DATES        causes all dates to be printed in the form DD-MMM-YY.
   NODATES      suppresses date, time and size information.
   SINCE <date> prints only files last updated on or after <date>.
                <date> can be in the form DD-MMM-YY or a dayname in the last
                week (e.g. MONDAY) or TODAY or YESTERDAY.
   UPTO  <date> prints only files last updated on or before <date>.
   P      <pat> searches for files whose name matches the pattern <pat>.
   S      <str> searches for filenames containing substring <str>.
   QUICK        prints a limited amount of information if this is quicker.
   SLOTS        for fileserver based systems, this gives the directory slot
                number for the entry.
   ALL          if ALL is specified then all sub-directories are also examined.
                This should preferably used with TO and the output sent to
                the lineprinter, since it is rather confusing at the terminal.
   WHO          if WHO is quoted then the initials of the creator of a file or
                directory will be given. WHO cannot be used with QUICK.
   FOR  <ulist> <ulist> should be a list of user's initials, separated by commas
                (eg., FOR=BJK,MFR,CGG). If given then only objects for those
                users will be listed.
   RAW          Produce raw format output -- not for reading by people.

   For information about the pattern used with the P keyword use HELP PATTERN.
   For information about the access matrices (e.g. /DAURW/ARW/RW/R) used
in the Filing Machine version of the filing system use HELP ACCESS MATRIX.
   In order to examine a directory interactively use the IEX command (use
HELP COMMAND IEX for further information).

Example:        EX
                EX :COM.BCPL S DISC
