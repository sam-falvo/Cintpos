UPDATE COMMAND

Form:           update FROM/A,TO/A,SAFE/S,QUIET/S
Purpose:        To update all the files that have been changed since the
                last time the program was run
Author:         RSC
Specification:

        update takes the two directories and compares the last access times
of all files of a similar name, then if the file in the FROM  directory has
a more recent date than the file in the TO directory the file is copied over.
        The program will recurse down the tree structure creating any
directories required. If the SAFE flag is given then it will just print out what
it would have done without doing any copying or creating. The QUIET flag turns
off all messages.

Examples:

        update home:src bd:back
        update island.vp island:voiceprovider safe

Bugs:
        The filing machine seems to have hicups every so often and sends the
names of the files in a directory twice.

        The program does not check for looped directories...
