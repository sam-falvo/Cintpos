Form:           LIBRARY  "FROM,OVERRIDE/S,CANCEL/K,TABLE/K"
Purpose:        To load a library of procedures and append it to the
                BLIB segment chain, thus allowing standard globals
                to be redefined.
Author:         RDE
Specification:
   FROM gives the file containing the library to be loaded.
   OVERRIDE allows loading of a library with the same (section) name
as an existing one, without CANCELling the old one.
   CANCEL specifies a section name, and causes the section of that
name to be unloaded.  Note that a new library will be loaded before
a CANCEL is done, so that it is possible to replace a library with
one of the same name in one command.
   TABLE has three possible arguments: NEW, ADD and DELETE.  It
controls the table of resident libraries used by the linkage editor.
NEW causes creation of a new table.  ADD causes the specified
library to be added to the table, and DELETE causes it to be
removed.
Example:        LIBRARY LIB
                LIBRARY LIB CANCEL LIB
                LIBRARY LIB OVERRIDE LIBRARY CANCEL LOADER

There are three resident libraries available on TRIPOS: a kernel library
KLIB, a machine code library MLIB and a BCPL library BLIB.  In order to
make a library of your own resident the LIBRARY command can be used.
Type one of the following:
        KLIB            -  Info about kernel library
        MLIB            -  Info about machine code library
        BLIB            -  Info about BCPL library
        COMMAND         -  Info on the LIBRARY command
        LKED            - Info on linking and the linkage editor
                          (which supports libraries in a more general sense)
        USER            - Info on the BCPL source library donated by users
Type <CR> to exit HELP.
