INIT command
Form:           INIT  "USER"
Purpose:        To set a current directory and obey its
                initialisation sequence.
Author:         ARA (Modified by CGG)
Specification:
        If DIR is specified then it is set, and if it contains an
    initialisation sequence (i.e. the file DIR.init-sequence) then that
    is obeyed.
        If no DIR is specified, the user's home directory is used if
    he has one and "T:" if he has not.
        INIT does not use the standard C command mechanism and does not
    write to the disc.  As a consequence, if INIT is used in a command
    file, any subsequent commands in that file are ignored.
        Related commands: SET, T, START
        For further information use HELP COMMAND <COMMAND>

Example:
        INIT :ADRIAN
                {SETs :ADRIAN as the current working directory
                 and executes the file INIT-SEQUENCE there, if there
                 is one, as a T command}
        INIT
                {initialises the user's home directory}
