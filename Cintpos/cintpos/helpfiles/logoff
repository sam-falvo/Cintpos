LOGOFF and FINISH command
Form:           LOGOFF
                FINISH
Purpose:        To return the TRIPOS machine being used to the
                Resource Manager.
Author:         BJK
Specification:
        Closes RATS terminal streams connected to TRIPOS, clears the
    FRIDGE of UID sets, stops polling the File Server and Resource
    Manger to assure them of the existance of any open files and a
    user for the machine respectively and tells the Resource Manager
    that it may reallocate the machine.
        Note: that the FINISH command is to be prefered - since it has
    the same function on most of the systems in your likely environment.
    The LOGOFF command is not available on TRIPOS implemented on 68000s.

Examples:

        LOGOFF
        FINISH
