SYSLINK command

Form:       SYSLINK  "FROM/A,TO/A,MAP/K"
Purpose:    To link Tripos system images
Author:     IDW

    The SYSLINK command takes as its input a description of a Tripos system,
and links together all the constituent files to form a system image.  This
image is suitable for SYSIMAGE or ANCILLA, depending on the nature of the
system being linked.

FROM     Is the name of the SYSLINK input file, describing the Tripos system
         to be linked.  See the PHOENIX file TRIPOS.ALL.SPEC:SYSLINK for 
         details of the syntax.

TO       Is the name of the SYSLINK output file, to which the system image
         is written.

MAP      Is the name of the SYSLINK map file.  If present, then a map of the
         linked system, giving addresses of segments, segment lists, TCBs,
         DCBs and so on.

    Note that this version of syslink is a new implementation of ARA's
original, and performs much more checking of parameters.  It is therefore
possible that systems which linked with the old version may fail initially
with the new.

    N.B. In order to make the new version of SYSLINK truly machine independent,
a new parameter "mcrelocinc" must be added to the system input file.  This is
analogous to the "mcaddrinc" parameter, and defines the increment used for
machine RELOCATION as opposed to ADDRESSING.  Typical values are:

    Machine       Mcaddrinc      Mcrelocinc
    =======       =========      ==========
