COMMAND FORM

The "Form:" given in HELP COMMAND <command> often gives the format of a command
in terms of its RDARGS string (use HELP RDARGS STRING for more information) --
see HELP HELP STANDARD for the specification of the way in which HELP is
provided for commands.

COMMANDS
     TRIPOS supports a large variety of different commands:
try HELP COMMAND <COMMAND> for details of a specific command.
Almost all the commands on TRIPOS will display their RDARGS string if
followed by a question mark - this is an easy way of determining any
particular syntax.  (Use HELP RDARGS STRING to get information about the
meaning of a RDARGS string).
     Commands are kept in the directory SYS:C (try EX :C to see the list).
     Use HELP ALL COMMANDS for a list of all the TRIPOS commands.  NOTE: that
the students version of TRIPOS (S-TRIPOS) does not include the full set of
commands.
     Use HELP FILE COMMANDS for a list of elementary FILE commands.
     Use HELP DIRECTORY COMMANDS for a similar list for DIRECTORIES.
     If a command is interactive the commands which can be used in its
operation can normally be found using HELP <command> COMMANDS.
     Use HELP COMMAND SEQUENCE for information about how to execute commands
listed in a files.
     For information about where the sources for commands can be found use
HELP COMMAND SOURCES.
     For information about documentation use HELP DOCUMENTATION.
     For information about the standards to be used when writing commands
use HELP STANDARDS.
