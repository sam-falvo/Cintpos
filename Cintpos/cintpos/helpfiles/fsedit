FSEDIT command
Form:           :SYS.FSFH.LSI4-OBJ.FSEDIT
             or :SYS.FSFH.68000-OBJ.FSEDIT
Purpose:        To give an interactive interface to fileserver commands
Authors:        BJK
Specification:
   The program has the concept of a current index and a current file: the
appropriate PUID is chosen when a fileserver operation is performed.

   Commands exists for doing most fileserver operations, and there are also
a few specifically oriented towards the TRIPOS filing system.  The program
is somewhat self-explanatory: RDARGS is used at all levels, so
typing '?' will produce a list of expected arguments.

   This program is obviously potentially very dangerous, so use with
great care!
