Form:           SCAN  "FILE/a,STOP,)/s,FROM=START=(,TO/k,NOLN,*
                      *W=WIDTH/k,P=PAGELENGTH/k,LN/s,BYTE/k"
Purpose:        To scan through a file
Author:         PB
Specification:
   SCAN types selected lines of the file.  To type lines n to m, format may be:
   m   OR   (n m)   OR   ( n m )   OR   m n
   n defaults to 1 and m to maxint.
   BYTE gives the number of bytes to skip (using POINT for speed),
   Unless NOLN is specified, line numbers are added.
   The program types <PAGELENGTH> of text and then waits for input, unless a TO
     file (other than *) is specified.  (pagelength is set by SETTERM).
     Q, W or @Q stop the typing; L makes it continuous.
     <number> causes <number> lines to be printed before the next halt.
   Ctrl/B will cause it to stop at the next convenient point.
   ESC will cause it to pagewait.
   For more information on command line syntax see HELP SCAN SYNTAX.

Example:        SCAN A ( 100 150 )
