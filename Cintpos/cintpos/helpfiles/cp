*cp
CP COMMAND

Form:           CP FROM/A,TO/A,CHARS/S,DATE/S
Purpose:        To copy one file to another
Author:         RSC
Specification:

        Similar to TRIPOS copy program expect that -

        *)  It uses readwords and writewords as default to copy the files and
        so is faster than copy.

        *)  If the file specified in the TO option is a directory then cp will
        copy the source file into the directory with a file name which is the
        same as the source.

        *)  If the DATE option is specified then the destination file will be
        postfixed with the creation or last modified date of the source file.
        The date is in the form DD-MMM where DD is the numeric date and MMM is
        the name of the month ie. jan, feb etc.

Examples:

        cp file to file2        does the obvious if file2 is a file

        cp file to dir          copies file to dir.file

        cp file to file2 date   copies file to file-DD-MMM
        
        cp file to dir date     copies file to dir.file-DD-MMM

Bugs:
        This program cannot be used with bsp: or anything else which does not
        support readwords and writewords so check before using it for copies
        other than from disc to disc unless the CHARS option is specified.
