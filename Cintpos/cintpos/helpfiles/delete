Form:           DELETE  ",,,,,,,,,,,VERIFY/S"
Purpose:        To delete up to ten files or directories.
Authors:        PB ARA
Specification:
   DELETE will attempt to delete each file or directory specified.
   This is will only be able to do if the user has 'D' access to the given
file or directory.  At creation files have 'D' protection status (and so can
be deleted) but directories do not.  Use the ALTER command to change the
protection status of a file or directory which does not already have 'D'
status.  If a directory is deleted then so are all of its files and  sub-
directories.
   For information about ALTER type HELP ALTER COMMAND.
   In order just to delete the contents of a directory use the SCRATCH
command (see HELP SCRATCH COMMAND).

Example:        DELETE OLD-FILE
                DELETE ALPHA BETA GAMMA

                ALTER My-Whole-Directory /D///
                DELETE My-Whole-Directory
** #I delete
