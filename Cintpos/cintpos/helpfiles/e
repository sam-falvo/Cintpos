*ex:
*exall:
The pseudo devices EX: and EXALL: give the effect of the EX program piped
into a user input stream.  The general form of the device name is:

    <device>:<directory>

where <device> is EX or EXALL, and <directory> is the name of a directory.
If no directory is given, then the current directory is taken by default.
The input stream gives a list of files in the relevant directory, each
separated by a newline character.  If EX is used, then the directory only
is searched;  EXALL searches sub directories as well.

Examples:      type ex:bcpl
               list files=ex::idw.fred opt=canon

Ambiguous names are allowed for directories and their contents.
The syntax is the same as for CP/M and UNIX, i.e.

       ?      Matches any character
       *      Matches any sequence of characters.

For example:

       ex:bcpl.*-s   matches   bcpl.fred-s, bcpl.eric-s, bcpl.wombat-s  etc.
       exall:file?   matches   file1, file2, file3  etc.
       ex:*-*        matches   a-b, remote-debug, fred-, -eric  etc.
