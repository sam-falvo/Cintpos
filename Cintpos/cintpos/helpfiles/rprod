Purpose:        To send a single basic block to a specified Ring station
Author:         BJK
Specification:
        A single block is sent to the given station, and a message
printed saying whether or not the transmission worked.

PORT specifies the port number on which the block is to be sent;
port 0 is used by default.

The remaining parameters control the contents of the block sent
and are intended as an aid for debugging BSP software. CLOSE
causes the block to be a BSP close block. Similarly, RESET sends
a BSP reset. REPLUG, TOMC, TOPORT, RXBS, TXBS generate a BSP replug
block with the specified arguments.

Example:
        RPROD ANCILLA
        RPROD ALPHA 987
        RPROD MICK 777 CLOSE
