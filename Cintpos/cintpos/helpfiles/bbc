               File transfer between TRIPOS and BBC micros
               -------------------------------------------

Files can be transferred between TRIPOS and a BBC micro running the PHX
terminal emulator. The relevant commands are FROMBBC and TOBBC.

  FROMBBC "TO/A/K,HEX/S" - transfers from BBC to TRIPOS
  TOBBC   "FROM/A,HEX/S" - transfers from TRIPOS to BBC

To use these:-

  1) Log in to TRIPOS via a Beeb running PHX.
  2) Make sure PHX has 'Auto Mode' off (Shift-F7).
  3) Press 'Get File' (Shift F3) or 'Send File' (Shift F2).
     You will be prompted first for a command line to send to TRIPOS: use
     FROMBBC with 'Send File' and TOBBC with 'Get File'.
     Secondly, you will be prompted for the BBC filename.

The above works for normal text files. To send binary files, you put PHX
into 'Hex Mode' (Shift F6), and quote the HEX switch to the TRIPOS
command.

Points to note
--------------

To send files from the BBC, you must use a UDN connection.
Getting files to the BBC works through a terminal concentrator as long
as no lines are longer than 80 characters. Long lines can be got from the
UDN by typing @DK at it (though this is an unadvertised facility which
may go away!).

There is a problem associated with sending files containing the '@' character
from a BBC machine (but not with receiving them). The PHX program only does
doubling of @s before transmission in 'auto mode'. Therefore to send a file
containing @s to TRIPOS, you must either go via Phoenix, or edit the file
before transmission to double all @s.

The file MICROLIB.BBCMICRO.TERMINAL on Phoenix contains more information
on the PHX program.
