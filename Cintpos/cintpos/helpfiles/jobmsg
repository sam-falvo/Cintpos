Form:           JOBMSG "From/S,String=file,To,Term/K"
Purpose:        To output its argument with "% variables" expanded.
Author:         CGG
Specification:
    Input is taken either from a file or from a string.  When input is
from a string FROM is not given and STRING is taken as the text to be
expanded.  Otherwise FROM is quoted and the file name from which input
is to be taken is given by FILE (which = STRING).  If no file name is
given the default input is used.  A file is read until either its end is
found or a line consisting only of the characters in the keyed string
TERM are found.  The default value for TERM is "/*".
    Input text is expanded and output either to the default output
(normally the screen) or the the file quoted after TO.
    Characters in the input text are normally copied straight through
to the output.  However the character '%' is an escape character used
to introduce one of the following expansions:

     Escape Sequence       Expands Into        Example Expansion
          %%           <percent>                      %
          %F           <name of the output file>      *
          %I           <current task number>          8
          %T           <the time>                     15:41:33
          %D           <the date>                     25-Nov-81
          %W           <the week day>                 Wednesday
          %K           <the machine kind>             LSI4
          %M           <the machine name>             ALPHA
          %P           <the user's PUID>              FF02B7A4415C1C3F
          %U           <the user's initials>          CGG
          %L           <name of loading machine>      TITAN.VDU/7
          %C           <reverse connection name>      RevCon-TITAN.VDU/7
          %V           <the vdu or terminal type>     Cifer2632

The special escape sequence "%=" has no expansion.  Any occurences of
%T, %W, %D or %U occuring after %= are forced to be re-evaluated however.
Escape sequences other than those given above will have an undefined
effect.

Examples:
    JOBMSG %M              - prints machine name
    JOBMSG FROM TO T:LOG   - info for log
    user %u (PUID=%p) logged on
       at %t on %m from terminal %l:%c
    /*
    JOBMSG "Executing in task %I"
