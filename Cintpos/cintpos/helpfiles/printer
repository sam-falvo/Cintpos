PRINT DEVICES

The devices currently available for hard copy output on TRIPOS are:

                  LP:        - the Mond printer on S-Tripos,
                               the Titan room printer otherwise
                  MP:        - the Mond printer
                  TP:        - the Titan room printer
                  CP:        - the Canon laser printer as a line printer
               CANON:        - interface to Canon for GCODE etc.

via the spool service (use HELP SPOOLER):

                 SLP:        - as LP:
                 SMP:        - as MP:
                 STP:        - as TP:
                 SCP:        - as CP:
              SCANON:        - as CANON:
                SCBM:        - Canon printer in bitmap mode
            SDIPRINT:        - Titan Room Diablo

These devices can be used as stream names anywhere that a file title may
be used.  When used as above a default banner is printed in most print
programs.  The specifiable part of the banner can be given by following
the colon of the device specification by the desired text. e.g.

                     COPY file MP:mytitle

If the chosen text contains embedded blanks it should be remembered that
most commands use RDARGS which allows strings in any argument position, so
quotes should be used:  e.g.

                     INPUT "LP:my file title"

If the printer stream cannot be opened, then the device will retry at
intervals, and will output occasional messages if the reason for failure
changes.  Two of the break flags are inspected:

 Ctrl/B - ends the retry loop and makes the call of FINDOUTPUT fail.
 Ctrl/E - produces a message giving the current reason for waiting.
