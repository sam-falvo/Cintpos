WRULTAPE command
Form:           "FILES,LRECL/K,BLKSIZE/K,VER/K,BINARY/S"
Purpose:        To write unlabelled tapes
Author:         IDW

Specification:
    WRULTAPE is a program to write an unlabelled tape, and is designed for
use when exporting files to other computer systems.  Files are written
on 9-track tape at 800-BPI, with a single tape mark separating files, and
a double tape mark signifying "end of tape".
      If the BINARY switch is set, then the files are copied onto the
tape without modification.  Otherwise, unprintable ASCII characters are
stripped, overlong records are split, and short records are padded with
blanks.  The last record written in each file is a multiple of LRECL bytes,
and if the transfer is binary, the last record is padded with NULs.

N.B.  The files are written starting at the beginning of the tape, and so 
      any data previously on the tape WILL BE LOST.


    FILES       is the name of a file containing a list of files to be
                moved onto tape.  The files are taken in sequential order,
                and written with one tape mark between each file.  A double
                tape mark is written at the end of the tape.  The files must
                be text, unless the BINARY switch is set.  If no FILES file 
                is given, the default of the terminal is taken.

    LRECL       is a number, specifying the Logical RECord Length of the
                files to be written (in bytes).  If no LRECL is given,
                the default of 80 is taken.

    BLKSIZE     is a number, specifying the BLocKSIZE of the files to be
                written (in bytes).  BLKSIZE must be EVEN, and an integral
                multiple of LRECL.  If no BLKSIZE is given, the default of
                LRECL*10 is taken.  (There is an implementation restriction,
                which means that BLKSIZE must be less than 8192).
                
    VER         is a file name which, if supplied, defines the output stream
                to which verification output is sent.  This information is
                useful if the tape is to be sent to another installation.
                
    BINARY      is a switch which, if set, causes no line imaging if the input
                files to be done.  Files are written exactly as they are on
                disc, with the last record being padded with NULs.

    N.B.  WRULTAPE does not refresh the dead man's handle in the Tape Server
          (see "The TRIPOS Tape Handler - IDW"), and so if an interactive
          session is chosen, care must be taken not to be idle for more than
          3 minutes, otherwise the tape server will time the session out.

Examples:

          WRULTAPE
          WRULTAPE t:files        LRECL=132  BLKSIZE=2640
          WRULTAPE :idw.file-list LRECL=120
          WRULTAPE                           BLKSIZE=8000
          WRULTAPE                LRECL=512  BLKSIZE=512    BINARY
