BALFOUR PRINTER

The Balfour LaserWriter is a high resolution laser printer.  It can be used as
a line printer via the device BP:title.
The printer page size is 92 characters by 73 lines.

The PRINT and LIST commands (q.v.) with option BALFOUR provide a convenient
means of printing files on the Balfour LaserWriter. Option CBALFOUR (Compact
Balfour) causes a small font (half normal size) to be used, allowing a large
amount of text to be fitted on a page. Option LBALFOUR (Landscape Balfour)
causes the text to be printed in Landscape mode (width greater than height),
and LCBALFOUR also makes it compact.

Bitmaps can be sent via the stream BSP:BALFOUROUT/title.

GCODE can be sent to the Balfour printer by using the GC2PS program

BCPLXREF COMMAND
Form:           BCPLXREF  "FROM/A,TO,OPT/K"
Purpose:        To produce a cross reference listing of identifiers
                in a BCPL source program.
Authors:        MR JJG BJK CGG
Source:         :com.bcpl.bcplxref
Specification:
   TO can be used to specify an output file.  By default, output
goes to the current output stream.  The OPT parameter gives a
pattern that selects which identifiers to cross reference.  The only
special character in the pattern is * which will match any string
of zero or more characters.

Example:        BCPLXREF PROG TO :T.0
*bd #H bigdisc
*bd: #H bigdisc

*bit #H #HCH %
%bucket
The stream name NIL: can be used to open streams which behave as infinite
sinks for output, or infinite sources of ENDSTREAMCH on input.

RING BOOT SERVER

Once upon a time this service was provided by a PDP11 called Mick.  This
has now demised, and is being replaced by a server called HOBNAIL!

The interface to this has not yet been finalised.  See SA for current state.
%tripos
Tripos machines are usually booted by the Ancilla machine at the request
of the Resource and Session Managers.  See HELP SESSION MANAGER for more info.
%*
There are various booting procedures for machines around the ring.  See HELP
SESSION MANAGER for info on booting a Tripos, HELP BOOTSERVER for info
about the booting service for Z80 machines etc.

*bsinfo
The BSINFO command may be used on systems with BJK's BSP handler to give
information about Ring byte streams currently open.  Note that Mace and Rex
Tripos systems do not use this handler, so the command will be ineffective.

BSINFO TRACE turns byte stream tracing on/off. (Note that will have an effect
only if the tracing code is compiled into the BSP handler task).

If the BSP handler task is not resident, then BSINFO KILL will cause it to
commit suicide when it next has no byte streams open.
*bsp
*stream
BSP stands for Byte Stream Protocol. This is a protocol used to provide
a bi-directional byte stream between two machines on the data ring. For
a description of the protocol, see the document "Ring Byte Stream Protocol
Specification" in the Titan Room documentation file.

This protocol has now been standardised as the JNT protocol "CR82".  This
is essentially a superset of Cambridge BSP.  Try HELP CR82 for info on this.

On Tripos, the stream names BSP: CR82: and AUTHBSP: (q.v.) can be used
for opening byte streams.
*bsp:
BSP: DEVICE

The stream name "BSP:service" can be used to open a byte stream pair to the
ring service called "service". The main result from calling FINDINPUT or
FINDOUTPUT on such a name will be a stream in the requested direction; RESULT2
will contain the other half of the stream pair. See the Phoenix file
TRIPOS.ALL.SPEC:RINGSW for more details.

*buildfaulttable #H #HCH %
%command
%*
Form:           BUILDFAULTTABLE "FROM,FAULTFILE/K,INFODIR/K,TRACE/S"
Purpose:        To construct the fault table in :INFO.FAULT-TABLE
                from the text file :INFO.FAULTS
Source:         :com.bcpl.buildfaulttable
Author:         MFR
Specification:

   The text file FROM (default sys:info.faults) is read to discover the text
message associated with each fault code, and this information is written to
the output file as described below.

   This command should be run whenever :INFO.FAULTS is altered.

   The name of the faults output file (which is of special format to be
read by the FAULT procedure (q.v.)) is constructed by concatenating the
given INFODIR (default sys:info) and the FAULTFILE (default faults-table).
If INFODIR is not null and does not end with ':' then a '.' is placed after it.

   The most useful key is INFODIR, which allows access to the faults table
using a profile assignment, rather then having direct access to sys:
e.g. if "info:" is "sys:info" then "buildfaulttable infodir info:" should work.

   If the TRACE key is given then each line is verified as it is written.
