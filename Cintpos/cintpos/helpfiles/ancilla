*CREATE
*ALL ..
The ANCILLA CREATE command

Form:    ANCILLA  CREATE  <mctype>  FILE=<object file>  NAME=<system name>
Author:  IDW

   The CREATE command is used  for adding new entries into the  ANCILLA
filing system. 
The load file FILE is entered into the ANCILLA filing system, under the
name NAME. Creation will fail if this system already exists.

Example:    ANCILLA  CREATE  lsi4  FILE=obj.tripos  NAME=tripos


*DELETE
*ALL ..
The ANCILLA DELETE command

Form:    ANCILLA  DELETE  <mctype>  NAME=<system name>
Author:  IDW

   The DELETE command  is used  for removing entries  from the  ANCILLA
filing system. 
The filing system entry for the name NAME is removed.  The system  must
obviously exist for this to be done.

Example:    ANCILLA  DELETE  68000  NAME=oldest-newest-mailserver


*REPLACE
*ALL ..
The ANCILLA REPLACE command

Form:    ANCILLA  REPLACE  <mctype>  FILE=<object file>  NAME=<system name>
Author:  IDW

   The REPLACE command is identical to the CREATE command, except that is
insists that the  system referenced  already exists,  and updates  that
system in place. 
The system whose name is NAME has its load file replaced by the file FILE.

Example:    ANCILLA  REPLACE  lsi4  FILE=t:fm-tripos  NAME=test-fm-tripos


*ALIAS
*ALL ..
The ANCILLA ALIAS command

Form:    ANCILLA  ALIAS  <mctype>  NAME=<system name>  NAME2=<system name>
Author:  IDW

   The ALIAS command is  used for attributing  a new name  to a  filing
system entry which already  exists, leaving both names referencing  the
same object. 
An entry is made in the filing system for the name NAME2, which references
the same  load  file as  the  system  whose  name is  NAME.   ALIAS  is
particularly useful, in that it enables a backup of a system to be taken,
and a new system installed, without having a transient period where the
system does not exist.  ALIAS requires that  NAME must exist, and NAME2
must not.

Example:    ANCILLA  ALIAS  68000  NAME=mace-tripos  NAME2=old-mace-tripos


*RENAME
*ALL ..
The ANCILLA RENAME command

Form:    ANCILLA  RENAME  <mctype>  NAME=<system name>  NAME2=<system name>
Author:  IDW

   The RENAME command changes the name of an object in the ANCILLA filing
system. 
The object whose name  is NAME, has its name changed to  NAME2.  RENAME
requires that NAME must exist, and NAME2 must not.

Example:    ANCILLA  RENAME  lsi4  NAME=tripos  NAME2=backup-tripos


*RELEASE
*ALL ..
The ANCILLA RELEASE command

Form:    ANCILLA  RELEASE  <mctype>  NAME=<system name>
Author:  IDW

   The RELEASE command release a new version of a boot file atomically.  The
effect of the RELEASE command is equivalent to the following:

         DELETE  NAME=backup-<system name>
         RENAME  NAME=<system name>      NAME2=backup-<system name>
         RENAME  NAME=new-<system name>  NAME2=<system name>

RELEASE requires that the "new-..." system exists.

Example:    ANCILLA  RELEASE  68000  NAME=tripos


*LIST
*ALL ..
The ANCILLA LIST command

Form:    ANCILLA  LIST  <mctype>
Author:  IDW

   The LIST command is used to examine the entries in the ANCILLA filing
system. 
The entries for the relevant arm of the filing system are printed out, as
name and PUID pairs.

Example:    ANCILLA  LIST  68000

*INIT
*ALL ..
The ANCILLA INIT command

Form:    ANCILLA  INIT  <mctype>
Author:  IDW

   The INIT command is used to re-initialise an arm of the ANCILLA filing
system. It is equivalent to using the DELETE command on each individual
entry. 
The relevant arm of the ANCILLA filing system is initialised, leaving it
with no entries.  Note that this command is  usually disabled, as it is
extremely dangerous!


*READLOG
*ALL ..
The ANCILLA READLOG command

Form:    ANCILLA  READLOG
Author:  IDW

   The READLOG command is used to read the log of recent changes to the
ANCILLA filing system. 
Descripitions of filing system changes; i.e. who changed what, and when,
are printed out.


*FLUSHLOG
*ALL ..
The ANCILLA FLUSHLOG command

Form:    ANCILLA  FLUSHLOG
Author:  IDW

   The FLUSHLOG command is used to remove all irrelevant entries from the
log file. 
All but the most recent log entry for each item in the filing system is
removed, and a new log file produced. This command is intended for  the
system manager's use, and should not normally be of interest to  anyone
else.


*CHUNKSIZE
*ALL
The ANCILLA CHUNKSIZE parameter

   For the  CREATE  and REPLACE  commands, there  is an  extra  keyword
CHUNKSIZE which can be quoted. This is the maximum size of a load  file
chunk which the ANCILLA will be asked to load into a target machine. The
default chunksize is 64K fileserver words, which means that most TRIPOS
systems will fit into 2 chunks.
   This should only be of interest for anyone attempting to load machines
across bridges or satellites, and  is a facility  which may be  removed
without notice.


*COMMAND  #I  ANCILLA
*+        #I  ANCILLA
