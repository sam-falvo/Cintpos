SUBMIT370 command
Form:           SUBMIT370   ",,,,,,,,,"
Purpose:        To submit a JOB to the 370
Author:         TJK
Specification:

    SUBMIT370 <file> [file]*
    takes the file(s) and places them into a virtual paper tape punch on
    the 370.  The start of the first file must contain a suitable job
    description, and lines may not be longer than 80 characters.
    The data in the job stream is converted from ASCII to EBCDIC at the
    PDP11/34 (just before the 370), and hence the translation tables are
    fixed. If, however, the first line after the end of the job description
    is a line containing
    +++B
    then the rest of the data will be passed untranslated to the 370.
