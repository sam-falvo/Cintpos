LSI4 ASM command
Form:           ASM  "PROG=FROM/A,CODE=TO,VER/K,LIST/S,HDR/K"
Purpose:        To invoke the assembler for the machine being used.
Authors:        RDE BJK
Specification:
   FROM is the source file.
   TO is the file for the object module.  If this is omitted then no
code is produced.
   VER is the file for messages.  By default, these go to the
current output stream.
   LIST turns on the assembly listing switch at the start of the
source.  (It may be turned off again by directives in the source).
If LIST is absent, only lines containing errors are listed.
   HDR specifies a header file to be textually inserted before the
source file.
   Assemblers for machines other than the host have similar
specifications, but have names indicating which machine they are
for: e.g. NOVASM, PDPASM, GASM.
    NOTE: the ZASM command is now recommended for use on the LSI4.
Example:        ASM ABC
                ASM ABC ABC-OBJ
                ASM ABC TO ABC-OBJ VER LP: LIST

N.B.  LSI4 ASM will only run on an LSI4 processor.
