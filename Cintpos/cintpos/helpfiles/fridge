FRIDGE
    The FRIDGE is a list of UID SETs (use HELP UID SET for more information)
hanging off the root node.  TRIPOS refreshes these UIDsets when running
normally to keep them "fresh" - for an hour every thirty seconds or so.
They will "go bad" an hour after a TRIPOS crashes or, if it is released
explicitly, will be deleted immediately.
    The CONSOLETASK for which a UIDSET was created in the FRIDGE is kept
with each UIDSET.  By convention the first UIDSET for a particular
CONSOLETASK in the FRIDGE is always that of the USER of that console - if it
is absent then no user is logged on.  A UIDSET LIST has the same format as
a UIDset except that an additional word, at offset zero, is used to point
to the next UIDSET LIST.  The first UIDset list is pointed to by:

               rootnode ! rtn.info ! rtninfo.ring ! ri.uidset

(The manifest RI.UIDSET is available in the RINGHDR header file).
    The UIDEDIT command is used to manipulate this list manually - use
HELP UIDEDIT COMMAND for more information.
    Various procedures for manipulating the FRIDGE from a BCPL program are
available in :G.BCPL - use HELP SOURCELIB for more information.
