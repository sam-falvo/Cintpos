The spec for Z80PATCH is the same as that for the symbolic version of
Z80DEB.  Which can be found in the CAP file:

Z80PATCH command
Form:           SYS:GRAY.LSI4.Z80PATCH  "HEXDUMP/A,DIC=HEX,FROM=WITH,STORE"
Purpose:        To debug an absolute Z80 core image.
Author:         CGG (from parts of Z80DEB by NJO)
Specification:

        Debugs an absolute Cambridge Hex file as generated by the Z80
    assembler, the linker CLINK or by the symbolic Z80 Debugger dump
    command.  This file is given with the HEXDUMP key.
        The HEXDUMP hex is read into store for debugging.  16K bytes are
    available for this by default - larger values can be specified using
    the STORE keyword.  The values given may either be the exact number
    of bytes or may be followed by 'K' to denote multiplication by 1024.
        A file containing Cambridge Hex that contains useful names (e.g.
    absolute Cambridge Hex that was linked using the I option) can be given
    using the DIC keyword and these names will be used during the Z80PATCH
    dialogue and are used in displaying information.  Any names found in
    HEXDUMP are used a similar manner.
        Commands are taken from the currently selected input stream
    by default or from the file given by the FROM keyword otherwise.
        Output is sent to the currently selected output stream by default
    but can be redirected to the file given by the TO keyword.
        The commands used are the same as those used in the symbolic Z80
    debugger.  For a description of these commands see the CAP file:
    .L.RING.SPEC.Z80SYMDCMDS

Examples:

    SYS:Gray.LSI4.Z80PATCH my-abs-hex-file
    SYS:Gray.LSI4.Z80PATCH dump-1 DIC my-dump-but-with-names STORE 32K
    SYS:Gray.LSI4.Z80PATCH dump-1 FROM patchcmds TO register-dump
