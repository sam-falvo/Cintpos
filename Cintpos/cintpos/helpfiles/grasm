MACRO ASSEMBLERS
    Test versions of some of the assemblers are currently available for
inspection.  These are for the 8080 and Z80.  The Z80 assembler currently
requires the command GLOBALS 400 to be executed before it can be loaded.
    These commands can be found in:

          NEW.6809
          NEW.z80
          NEW.6502
          8080
          9900

    More assemblers may become available in time.
    A preliminary specification of the macro processing features can be
found in the CAP file .CGG.MACRO

Purpose:        To cross assemble into Cambridge Hex
Author:         CGG
Specification:
        Assembles the assembly code in the file given by the first
    key word.  If 'To' is given Cambridge Hex is generated and sent
    to that file.  A listing (just the errors by default) will be
    sent to the file given by the 'List' key word or to the terminal
    if this key word is ommitted.
        Note that the 9900 assembler can be used to assemble code for the 9995.
        Options:
                S<n>    - set symbol table store size to <n> default 3000
                L<n>    - set assembler listing level to <n> default 0 if
                          L not given, or 1 if <n> not given.  Essentially
                          <n> levels of GET files will be listed - unless
                          any LIST directives are used in the assembler.
                W<n>    - set width of listing to <n> default 80
                P       - include page headings and page throws in the
                          listing.
                C       - make listing concise: do not generate error
                          pointers.  (for listing errors to slow terminals).
        For detailed information about these assemblers see the documentation
    on CAP:  roff  .ring.spec.Z80*3  .ring.spec.6809*3   .ring.spec.6502*3
        For information about linking the output from these assemblers use
    HELP CLINK.
        GET file commands will use files named in SYS:RING.Z80, SYS:RING.6809,
    SYS:RING.6502, SYS:RING.8X300  etc.  if files cannot be found in the
    current environment.
        These assemblers are also available, with similar interfaces on the
    IBM, CAP and on RSX.
        For information about how to use the rings microprocessor developement
    system in general see "Microprocessor Use On The Ring" in the documentation
    folder.
