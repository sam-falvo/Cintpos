T COMMAND
Form:           T  "FILE/A,IFEXISTS/S"
Purpose:        To switch the command input stream to the given
                file.
Author:         ARA BJK
Specification:

   T behaves rather like the C command, but does not do parameter
substitution.  Therefore it does not need to write to disc, and so can
be used to execute command files during file handler restart.  It may
also execute faster.

   However, it works in a more simple minded manner than C and will
switch the standard input stream back to the terminal when it has
terminated - not the input stream current at its time of calling.
The practical upshot of this is that it does not "return" when used in
a command file, and therefore should only be used as the last command
in a command file.

   The IFEXISTS switch will cause the command not to report its failure if
FILE could not be opened.

   Use HELP COMMAND SEQUENCES for more information about the commands
available in a command file.

Example:        T ABC
                T INIT-SEQUENCE IFEXISTS

*T: #H file
*tapeserver #H tape
*tcb #H task
*term #H terminal
*terminate
To terminate a session, do one of the following:

- Type the FINISH command to TRIPOS.

- Type <BREAK> D to delete one terminal concentrator channel

- Type <BREAK> QU to kill all terminal concentrator channels

- On UDN terminals, type <Control-P> C  to clear the connection
*termtype #H setterm
*tex
TEX does not run on TRIPOS.  TEX will run on the VAX, but if you still want
to use TRIPOS, then GCAL is a good alternative.  See HELP GCAL and HELP CANON
for further information.
*textscan
The TRIPOS command CHKL can be used to find the number of lines and characters
in a text file.  CHKW will report on the number of words.
*tidyup
On LSI4s only, a TIDYUP routine may be provided in a program in order that
the KILL command can call it.  See HELP KILL COMMAND.
*tlsinit #H tls
*tobbc #H f
*tophx
Use CS INPUT to send files to Phoenix/MVT.

*tpuid #H uidset
*transfer #H file
*tsbsp #H sourcelib

*ttp ..
The TTP protocol is not supported on Tripos.

Form:           TYPE  "FROM/A,TO,OPT/K"
Purpose:        To type a text file.
Author:         ARA
Specification:
   TO specifies an output file; by default, output is to the current
output stream.
   OPT N causes line numbers to be included in the output.
   Tabs are expanded.
   Try HELP PRINT COMMANDS for a list of other file output commands.

Example:        TYPE T:0 OPT N
