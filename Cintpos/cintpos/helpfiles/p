*pack
Form:           PACK  "FROM/A,TO/A,SWOP/S"
Purpose:        To convert a file from characters to words, optionally
                swapping the bytes.
Author:         ARA
Specification:
  PACK copies a file, reading it with RDCH and writing with WRITEWORDS.  It
is relevant to disc filing systems only.

  SWOP causes the byte order within a word to be reversed during the copy
(this will work only for systems with 16-bit words).
*packserver
The Packserver provides a ring service which, given a fileserver PUID, tells
you which fileserver to talk to in order to access the object the PUID refers
to.  Documentation is available in the Titan Room documentation drawer.

A routine which yields a filserver address from a puid is available
as a BCPL source library and in CALLSEGable form.  See
HELP CALLSEG FIND-FILESERVER or HELP SOURCELIB FIND-FILESERVER for details.

*pause
A pause in the typing of output may be instigated by typing space.
The output will pause at the end of a line.  The pause may be
terminated using CTRL/X, @L or <CR>.
    Alternatively BREAK can be pressed - entering the terminal
concentrator on RING TRIPOSes : the output will be halted at a convenient
point and a "Monitor> " prompt will appear.  Any control character will
cause the prompt to be rubbed out and the output to continue.

*Pipeinfo
Form:           PIPEINFO
Purpose:        To inspect pipes
Author:         MFR
Specification:
   PIPEINFO alone reports on the states and names of existing pipes.

   See HELP PIPES for more information on the PIPE: pseudo device
*pkt #H packet
*pktwait
PKTWAIT
      To wait for a packet to be sent to the task.
      pkt := pktwait (taskid, packet)
      The pktwait routine calls taskwait to wait for any
packet to be sent to the task, and returns this packet 
as its result.
      The purpose of having this routine is to allow
users to define a PKTWAIT suiting their own queueing requirements
- e.g. one in which packets arriving before expected are held on an
internal queue and in which PKTWAIT always returns the packet given as
an argument. All system functions will pass through the modified
pktwait - i.e. all BLIB routines call pktwait rather then taskwait.

PostScript is a device independent printer code used by e.g. the Apple

from GCAL, into PostScript.  See HELP on these for more info.
*pound
There is a pound-sign included in the Computer Modern italic character set
accessible via GCODE to the Canon.  It corresponds to the $ character.
Thus to access it go "$it ~~$ $f".

HELP knows about the procedures in BLIB, KLIB and MLIB.
For a list of the procedures that it knows in either of these libraries
type BLIB, KLIB or MLIB.  For information about the BCPL source library for
users type SOURCE.  For information about a particular procedure use
HELP PROCEDURE <name of the procedure>.  To exit HELP just type <CR>.

PUT2BYTES

  This is a function in MLIB for putting a 16-bit word at a
specified offset (in 16-bit words) in a BCPL vector. It is the
16-bit analogue of BYTEPUT.
