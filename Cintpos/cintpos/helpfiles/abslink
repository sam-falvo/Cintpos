Form:           ABSLINK   "FROM/A,TO/A,MAP/K,OPT/K"
Purpose:        To biuld a new TRIPOS binary bootstrap.
Author:         ARA
Specification:
         The TRIPOS absolute linker is used to build an
      absolute object file representing the contents of the
      store of a TRIPOS memory space, which can then be
      loaded and started by the bootstrap loader, or run as
      a mapped task.

         The FROM argument should be the name of a file of
      directives for the linker describing the object file
      to be built, and the TO argument should be the name of
      the required object file.

         The MAP keyword may be used to obtain a map of the
      system, in which case it should be followed by a
      suitable filename for the mapping output.

         The OPT keyword may be used to supply options;
             Wn  sets the workspace size
             F   specifies full map output
             O   map values to be octal machine addresses
             X   map values to be hex hacnine addresses
