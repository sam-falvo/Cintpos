OBSERVE command
Form:           OBSERVE   "TASK,TICKS,NOPROC/S,HELP/S"
Purpose:        To monitor CPU usage by task and procedure.
Author:         JD + IML + PB
Specification:
        This command runs at low priority for TICKS/50 seconds.  It then
    runs at the highest possible priority inspecting the stacks of each
    task (or the single task TASK) in the system.  It accumulates
    information about which procedure is running in each task (or if
    NOPROC only which task is running).  This information is displayed
    whenever the command is broken with CTRL D.  The information, in terms of
    which procedure in which task has been using what percentage of the CPU,
    on the basis of how often it was found to be running during the passed
    samples, is also printed when the command is ended with CTRL B.
    The tables are cleared with CTRL C, and the task is deactived with CTRL E.
        If HELP is specified a brief description of the command is given.

Examples:

    RUN OBSERVE TASK 1
        Observe will start to run in another task and monitor task 1.
        A command executed at task 1 (if it is a CLI) will thus be measured.
        The task in which OBSERVE is running should be selected and
        periodically broken using CTRL D to observe the progress of the
        monitored command.
        When the command has finished OBSERVE is broken with CTRL D and
        will print a summary of the commands performance.

    OBSERVE NOPROC
        will obtain statistics about the relative activity in each of the
        system's tasks.
