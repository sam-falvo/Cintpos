Form:           FAILAT  "RClim"
Purpose:        To set the return code level at which a command
                sequence will fail.
Author:         CGG
Specification:
       The argument should be a positive number.  The fail level will be
    reset to cli.initialfaillevel (currently 'return.hard' =  10) on exit
    from a command sequence, hence its effect is local to a command sequence.
       The current value of 'cli.faillevel': the value which a command's
    return code must reach before a command sequence is exited, will be
    displayed if no argument is given.
        Use HELP STOP PROCEDURE for information about how to set a return
    code from a command.

Example:        FAILAT 25
