RENUMBER command
Form:           AJW.RENUMBER "FROM/a,MANIFEST=NAME/a,TO/k"

Purpose:        To renumber global declarations in a header file.

Author:         AJW after CEB after DWS
Restriction:    ******* This command will only run under AJW-Tripos ******

Specification:

  As it passes through the file, it replaces every occurrence of
        MANIFEST+<number>
with    MANIFEST+<new number>,
where <new-number> starts at zero and is incremented each time it is used.
  The effect is to reassign offsets from the same manifest name in increasing
order down the length of the file.  It is particularly useful after some new
global declarations have been edited into a header file, or the existing ones
reordered.
  MANIFEST may be in mixed case in the file.  There must be no spaces betwixt
MANIFEST and +, although the number may be preceded by leading spaces and tabs.
Substitution takes place withoug regard to strings or comments.
  If no outputfile is given then it will attempt to write the updated version
back to the inputfile, preserving the old input file as t:RENUMBER-BACKUP.


Bugs:
  If a tab is encountered betwixt the manifest and the number it is converted
into a space without a murmer.
  The name of the backup file isn't task-specific.

Examples:
        ajw.renumber bcp.thing GBASE
        ajw.renumber bcp.thing name=WombatBase to t:new
