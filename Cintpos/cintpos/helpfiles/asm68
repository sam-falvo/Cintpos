68000 ASM command
Form:           ASM  "PROG=FROM/A,CODE=TO/K,VER/K,LIST/S,HDR/K,OPT/K"
Purpose:        To assemble a 68000 assembly code program
Author:         IDW

Specification:
   FROM is the source file.
   TO is the file for the object module.  If this is omitted then no
code is produced.
   VER is the file for messages.  By default, these go to the
current output stream.
   LIST is the file to which an assembly listing is sent. If it is
omitted, then no listing is produced, even if LIST directives are
encountered in the source.
If LIST is absent, only lines containing errors are listed.
   HDR specifies a header file to be textually inserted before the
source file.
   OPT specifies the option string to be handed to the assembler.
Relevant options here are:

   X     Produce a cross reference to the LIST stream
   H     Cambridge HEX object module (sent to CODE stream)
   M     Motorola object module (sent to CODE stream)
   S     Dump the Symbol table for use with DEBUG68
   Wn    Set workspace size to "n" words

Example:        ASM abc
                ASM abc TO abc-obj
                ASM abc TO abc-obj VER lp: LIST t:listing


N.B.  68000 ASM will only run on a 68000 processor.
