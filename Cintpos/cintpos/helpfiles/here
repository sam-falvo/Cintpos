     The pseudo-device here: provides in-stream files in much the same manner
as here datasets on the IBM. For example:
     copy here:% to wombat
     some text ...
     %
     The stream is introduced by here:<char> where <char> is any character.
Input will then be taken from the same input stream, until a line beginning
with the single character <char> is encountered. If the program closes the
stream before <char> is encountered, then input will be skipped up to such a
line.
     Only "rdch" is supported; use of readwords will return zero words read.
If the program reads the current input stream then such reads will be mixed
up with reads through here: - thus:
     edit here:% to wombat
     text ....
     %
     will give unpredictable results, as "text ...." may be swallowed by edit
either as source file or as commands.
     Note that here: starts from the point just after the input taken by
"rdargs" so that:
     copy here:% to wombat ; type wombat
     more text ...
     %
     will result in the file "wombat" containing two lines, "type wombat", and
"more text ....".
     Typically, here: is useful in command files, for example with ringprint:
     ringprint ,here:% to canon opt n
     file1
     .....
     filen
     %
