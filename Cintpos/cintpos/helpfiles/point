POINT Procedure

RESULT  := POINT( SCB, VECTOR )

POINT allows the file pointer in an open file to be set to a position recorded
previously by NOTE.

SCB is the stream control block for the file (the result from FINDUPDATE).
VECTOR is a vector with upperbound at least 2 in which the file pointer has
       been stored by a previous call of NOTE.
RESULT is zero if the call fails, non-zero if it succeeds.

Both NOTE and POINT are in the NOTE-POINT library (SYS:L.NOTE-POINT) which
should either be APPENDed to your program, or loaded with the LIBRARY command.

NOTE and POINT should be used with READWORDS and WRITEWORDS only. The effect
of using them with RDCH and WRCH is undefined.
