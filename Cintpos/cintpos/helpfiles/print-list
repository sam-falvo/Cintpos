PRINT/LIST commands

Form:          "FILE,FILES/K,TO/K,OPT/K"
Purpose:       General purpose, multi columning print program
Author:        IDW

Specification

PRINT/LIST takes one or more input files, and processes them, producing output
suitable for a variety of printers.  The options available are many and varied,
and should be general enough for any desired format of output to be generated.

    FILE   If specified, FILE corresponds to a file to be printed.  This file
           only is printed.

    FILES  If specified, FILES corresponds to a file containing a list of
           files to be printed.  This file must be a series of lines each
           containing the name of a file to be printed.  If neither FILE 
           nor FILES is specified, then PRINT/LIST prompts the user for 
           the names of files to be printed.  The device EX: can be used
           to examine a directory in order to produce a FILES list.  See
           HELP EX: for details.

    TO     If specified, TO corresponds to the name of a file into which the
           print image is to be placed.  This overrides the implied name of
           the printer to be used, given the options string.

    OPT    If specified, OPT corresponds to an options string relating to the
           print run.  It is in this options string that the format of the
           printer for which the output is destined is given.  The options
           apply to all files printed in this run.  See HELP PRINT OPTIONS
           for a list of the options known to the PRINT/LIST program.
