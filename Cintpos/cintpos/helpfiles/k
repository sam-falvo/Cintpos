*Keys
Form:           KEYS "F1,F2,F3,F4, ... CLEAR/s,LIST/s,NOSET/s,INIT/k"
Purpose:        To set, clear or display a preferred set of function keys
Author:         PB

Specification:

   The specified strings are associated with the relevant keys. The strings
may contain *B, *C, *E, *N, *P, *S or *ooo where ooo is an octal number.

   Unless NOSET is specified, the program attempts to set the function keys
to the latest value of the specifed strings, but this may fail, e.g. if the
strings are too long.

   If CLEAR is specified, the remembered string values are lost, but the
actually functions keys may not be reset. Note that SETTERM deletes the
strings.

   If LIST is specified, then the keys are listed.

   The INIT string is transmitted each time keys is called.

*Kill
KILL command
Format:         KILL  "task/a,substitute/s"
Purpose:        Program to kill another task.
Author:         BJK

Warning:        *** This command is available on LSI4s only. ***

Specification:

   The victim task is forced to execute the global TIDYUP as if it were
at the outermost level of the current coroutine.  This global may be the
standard BLIB routine, or may have been overridden within the task.

   If the global is unset in the victim then the command will refuse to
work unless the switch SUBSTITUTE is set, in which case a call will be
made to the standard TIDYUP routine.
