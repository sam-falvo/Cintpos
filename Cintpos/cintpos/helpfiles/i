*idvec
Form:           IDVEC  "ADDRESS/A"
Purpose:        To try to identify the vector at the given address.
Author:         BJK
Specification:

   The given address is rounded up to make it odd if necessary, as
all vectors delivered by GETVEC have odd addresses.

   The program may be invoked from another program by using CALLSEG.
 e.g.  callseg("sys:c.idvec", unidentified.vector)

Example:        IDVEC 10445
*iebupdte
IEBUPDTE is the wonderfully meaningful name that IBM give to their format
for concatenated text files.  Tripos commands CS PACK and CS UNPACK use
this format, which is compatible with the Phoenix program FILEPDS.
*image
The TAB and PRINT commands will both perform line imaging.  See HELP TAB and
HELP PRINT for further information.

%vector
The info vector is a vector hanging from the rootnode (q.v.) containing
system-specific information.  The offset of the pointer in the rootnode,
and the standardly defined fields are defined in :g.libhdr.  Several of
the entries are themselves vectors.

Try HELP DOCUMENTATION for where to get general system information.
There is also a filespace SYS:INFO which contains system information files,
a system data structure called the INFO VECTOR - see HELP on this, and
a pseudo-device INFO:.

*initialise-floppy
Form:           C INITIALISE-FLOPPY  "NAME/A,DRIVE/A/K"
Purpose:        To initialise a floppy disc to contain an empty
                filing system.
Author:         PB
Source:         :s.initialise-floppy
Specification:
   Mount floppy in drive <x>, then type:
 C INITIALISE-FLOPPY NAME Paul-A DRIVE <x>
Example:        C INITIALISE-FLOPPY NAME Paul-B DRIVE 0
*initio
INITIO
      To initialise input-output globals.
      initio ()
      The current input and output stream globals are set to
zero.  The  current directory global is set to zero, and the
consoletask global is set to  the  default  console  handler
task ( manifest task.consolehandler ).

*interrupt
*interrupted
A Tripos task is in INTERRUPTED state when a packet is sent to a higher
priority task, causing it to become active.  The interrupted task is
resumed as soon as the higher priority task suspends itself.
*infoterm
The ring INFOTERM service can be used to find out the ring name of the terminal
from which it is invoked.  Use:

C INFOTERM

after a terminal concentrator "Monitor >" prompt.
*initialisation #H init-sequence
*iohdr
IOHDR is the name of the header contain all information dealing with
Input/Output.  The source is in "sys:g.iohdr".
