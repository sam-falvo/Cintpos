LOGGING ON

To log on to a Data Ring machine via the CUDN, respond to the "Logon:"
prompt on a CUDN terminal with "TO RING/name" where "name" is the name
you would have typed after the Terminal Concentrator C command. For example:

Logon: TO RING/S-TRIPOS

TERMINAL USER INTERFACE

The character DLE (CTRL/P) provides a 'network escape'; i.e. sequences DLE
followed by a character provide various control functions.  For example:

  DLE A enters CUDN command mode
  DLE B is the alternative to BREAK
  DLE C at present clears the connection
  DLE D is the alternative to RUBOUT (DEL) to delete the last character
  DLE E turns echo off and on.
  DLE T causes the input line to be transmitted without adding a character
  DLE control-char enters the control character as data.

See HELP CONTROL CHARS for information on how to send control characters to
either the TRIPOS terminal handler, or to the final program.

Note that the CUDN always works in line mode for input, so it is very tedious
to use programs which require single-character input (e.g. screen editors,
DEBUG68) via it.

Note also that the CUDN allows only one connection per terminal. One way round
this is to connect to TRIPOS, set up several CLIs, and use the STAR command
to set up further connections.
