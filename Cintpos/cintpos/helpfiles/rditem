RDITEM
      To read an item from the input stream.
      res := rditem ( vec, size )
      An item is read from the input stream (  normally  the
command  line  ) and placed in the vector 'vec' as a string.
Unused bytes in the vector are set to zeroes.
      The  result is -2 if an equal symbol is encountered, 0
for the '*N', '*E', and endstreamch characters, 1 if an  un-
quoted  string  is found, 2 if a quoted string occurs, or -1
in the event of an error ( the item is too big for the  vec-
tor; 'size' should be the size of 'vec' in words ).
      All strings, quoted  or  unquoted,  are  teminated  by
'*N', '*E', and endstreamch characters. Unquoted strings are
also terminated by ';', '=', and space.
      Examples :
      DP0: INIT :L.FH-INIT-X
      vec <- "DP0:"
      "BSP:PRINT/ TEST " ; SET
      vec <- "BSP:PRINT/ TEST "
