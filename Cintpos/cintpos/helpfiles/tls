Form:         "DICT/A,WITH/K,VER/K,INIT/S,NOTAPE/S,TAPEDEVICE/K,WORK/K"
Purpose:      Tape Library System, with incremental archiving
Author:       IDW

Specification:
    TLS is a Tape Library System, based on the one supported by the Computing
Service.  Its purpose is to provide a convenient interface to the TRIPOS tape
handler, via the device MT:.
    Incremental file archiving and restoration are implemented, along with easy
manipulation of files and directories.
    TLS maintains its master dictionary on Disc, but keeps a copy of it
as the last file on a TLS tape.  This means that the tape can be recovered,
even if the disc dictionary is deleted.

    DICT is the name of the TLS disc dictionary.  It must always be quoted.
    WITH is the name of the TLS command stream.  If none is given, the default
         of "*" (the terminal) is taken.
    VER  is the name of the TLS output stream.  If none is given, then the
         system default output stream is taken.
    INIT is a switch, allowing a user to initialise a TLS disc dictionary.
         If INIT is specified, then the DICT file must not exist.
    NOTAPE is a switch which allows TLS to be used without the device MT: being
         mounted.  NOTAPE mode is designed particularly for EXamination, thus
         avoiding the need for a separate TLSEX program, but can be used
         equally well with ARCHIVE or RESTORE to find out what WOULD be
         transferred if the real tape operation were to take place.
    WORK is an alternative file which TLS can use as a work file. Normally,
         TLS creates a work file in the same directory as the dictionary,
         thus avoiding the problem of renaming across disc packs.  However,
         this is only reasonable if the directory is not protected.

    (TAPEDEVICE is the name of an alternative tape device name.  If none is
     specified, the default of MT: is taken.  This facility is provided
     purely for debugging, and should not be generally used).

Commands to TLS:

    TOTAPE (TT)   <name>              [AS <name>]  [COMMENTS "<comments>"]
                                      [INCLUDE <list>]  [EXCLUDE <list>]

    ARCHIVE       <name>              [AS <name>]  [COMMENTS "<comments>"]
                                      [INCLUDE <list>]  [EXCLUDE <list>]

    FROMTAPE (FT) <name> or SEQ <seq> [AS <name>]  [VERSION <version>]
                                      [INCLUDE <list>]  [EXCLUDE <list>]

    RESTORE       <name> or SEQ <seq> [AS <name>]  [VERSION <version>]
                                      [INCLUDE <list>]  [EXCLUDE <list>]

    EXAMINE (EX) [<name>]             [FULL] [ALL] [FIFO] [LIFO] [TO <file>]

    QUIT (Q)

    ABANDON

Where:   <name>       is the name of a TRIPOS file or directory
         <comments>   is arbitrary text, terminated by a newline
         <list>       is a series of <name>s, separated by commas
         <file>       is the name of a TRIPOS file
         <seq>        is a file sequence number, in decimal


Whereas TOTAPE and FROMTAPE always transfer files, the incremental archiving
commands, ARCHIVE and RESTORE do not.

    ARCHIVE transfers files to tape ONLY if the files do not exist on TAPE,
            or have a "last modified" date more recent on DISC than on TAPE.
            
    RESTORE transfers files from tape ONLY if the files do not exist on DISC,
            or have a "last modified" date more recent on TAPE than on DISC.


N.B.  Although TLS will run on both 68000 and LSI4 machines, the working
      dictionary size is limited by the amount of memory available.  If a
      dictionary of >500 entries is required, it is advised that a 68000
      machine be used.
