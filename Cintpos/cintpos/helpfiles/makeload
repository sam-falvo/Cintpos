*MAKELOAD
Form:    makeload FROM/A,TO/A,COMMAND/S,AD/K,START/K,TRAP/S,VERBOSE/S
Purpose: Converts TRIPOS hunks into UNIVERSE boot format for loading
         into VME machines

The arguments are as follows -

        FROM -  name of the file from which to take either the TRIPOS hunks or
                commands.

        TO -    name of the file in which to put the output.

        COMMAND flag to indicate whether the file specified in the FROM
                argument contains TRIPOS hunks or commands.  If it is given
                then the file should contain commands.

        AD -    name of the machine which the RIP should try and contact if it
                gets into any difficulty.  This may be overwritten by ripload
                if required.  If a name is not specified then ripload will put
                in the name of the machine on which it is being run.

        START - the address at which execution of the program should start. 
                This defaults to LOCALRAMBASE. (See vme:g.asm.VMEhdr)

        TRAP -  this is used to say whether or not the RIP should try and 
                contact the machine specified by the active debug string before
                starting the program that has just been loaded.  If TRAP is not
                given then the RIP will start the program.
                
        VERBOSE normally no information on the file that is being processed
                will be printed.  However if VERBOSE is given makeload will
                print out a list of the hunks to be loaded, the number of
                unmerged and merged hunks and a map of the merged hunks.
                
        
        If a command file is used then the input file should consist of lines
containg one of the following commands -

        IMAGE <file>
        CODE  <file>            name of the file from which to read TRIPOS
                                hunks

        DEFAULT-DEBUG <name>
        DD <name>               similar to active debug except that the RIP
                                will not try and contact the machine unless
                                it cannot get in touch with the machine
                                given by the active debug

        ACTIVE-DEBUG <name>
        AD <name>               As above

        AUTH <number>           A 64 bit number which will be used by the RIP
                                to validate futher load requests. The default
                                value is FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

        START <addres>          As above

        OFFSET <address>        Allows the user to create a bootfile for dual
                                processor systems or where code for a machine
                                is to be loaded into two disjoint places in 
                                memory.  After the command all addresses for
                                load blocks will have the offset added to them.

        ENTER-DEBUG
        TRAP                    As above

        TITLE <string>          All characters after title up to the end of the
                                line are ignored except that they will be 
                                printed out by ripload.

        If an argument is given which is the same as one of the commands in the
command file then the argument will take priority.
