STOP
        This procedure is used to cease execution of a command or task
    and pass back a return code.
                      stop(rc)
        General meanings of the return code are (given the manifests in
    CLIHDR):
                return.ok       -  success
                return.soft     -  minor error: a warning
                return.hard     -  normal error return
                return.severe   -  severe error: stop processing
        For more information about return codes use HELP RC.
        If 'rc' is not zero (return.ok) then, in the case of a command
    'result2' will be copied into the CLI so that it can be displayed
    using the WHY command (use HELP WHY COMMAND for more info here).
        If the return code returned is greater than or equal to
    'cli.faillevel' then processing of command commands will be terminated:
    see HELP FAILAT COMMAND for information as to how this limit can be
    changed: its default value is 'return.hard'.
        It is not compulsory to end a program using 'stop'.
