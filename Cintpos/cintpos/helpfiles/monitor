Form:           MONITOR delay=ticks,pri=1/k,mult=100/k
Purpose:        Continuous monitoring of system activity.
Author:         PB
Specification:

   Runs on cursor addressable VDUs only, currently Cifer 2632 and Newbury 7009.
(See HELP SETTERM)
   It draws a store map (similar to MAP PIC), and gives number of
tasks, number of devices, and free store information.  Also listed
are the currently loaded commands, with their task numbers.
   Use CNTL/B to stop the command, CNTRL/E to redisplay the sreen.
   The delay between sampling is the first argument, the second gives the
priority of the task. This defaults to 1, which means that things are often
missed, but at least it doesn't hog the cpu.
   Each store line is arranged so that if possible, it is a multiple of mult.

Example:        MONITOR
                MONITOR pri=1001                // should show everything
                MONITOR 2
