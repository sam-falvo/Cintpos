ASSIGN command
Form:           ASSIGN   "NAME,DIR,TASK/K,LIST/S,NODELETE/S"
Purpose:        To set up a logical name for a directory or task.
Author:         BJK
Specification:

Directories and tasks may be given temporary alternative names with this
command.  The assigned name has the same form as a device name  -  i.e. it ends
with a colon.  After an assignment to a directory has been made, the new name
becomes an alias for the full name of the directory, and can be used in place
of it for filing system operations. The BLIB routine DEVICETASK returns the task
number and filing system lock associated with an assigned name.

NAME gives the assigned name. If neither DIR nor TASK is specified, then the
assignment for NAME is deleted.

DIR gives the name of a directory or set of directories to which an assignment
is to be made.  The assignment holds a lock on the directory (rather than its
text name).  Multiple directories may be concatenated together using the
character '+'.

TASK gives a task number to which the assignment is to be made. Task assignments
to filing system tasks behave like assignments to the root directory. Only one
of DIR and TASK may be given.

LIST asks for a list of all existing assignments to be printed. This is done
after any other operations have been performed.

If NODELETE is quoted, then any attempt to replace or delete an existing
assigned name will fail.

Examples:
        ASSIGN PROGS: :BRIAN.BCPL
            sets up an assignment so that the file :BRIAN.BCPL.MAP (for
            example) could be accessed by the name PROGS:MAP.

        ASSIGN COM1: MYOBJ+HISOBJ
            sets up an assignment to a pair of directories, which can then
            be treated as a single read-only directory.
