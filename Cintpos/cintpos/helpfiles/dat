DATSTAMP

  DATSTAMP is a procedure in BLIB for obtaining a self-consistent date
and time stamp. It takes a 3 word vector as argument:

  RESULT := DATSTAMP(DATVEC)

  On exit: RESULT is set to DATVEC
           DATVEC!0 contains the number of days since 1st Jan 1978
           DATVEC!1 contains the number of minutes since midnight
           DATVEC!2 contains the number of 'ticks' in the current minute
*datstring
*string
DATSTRING
      To obtain strings for the various parts of the date and
time.
      v := datstring(v)
      A call of datstring with an argument vector of 15 words
yeilds strings at the following locations in the vector:
                v      -  Date       DD-MMM-YY
                v+5    -  Time       HH:MM:SS
                v+10   -  Weekday    (its full name)
*dat-to-string ..
*dat-to-strings
DAT-TO-STRINGS is a CALLSEGable procedure which will convert a date and time
held in binary form into string form.

Use:    CALLSEG("SYS:L.DAT-TO-STRINGS", DATV, V)

Returns V containing 3 strings representing the time and date given in DATV,
where DATV!0 = days, DATV!1 = mins, DATV!2 = ticks (i.e. the format delivered
by DATSTAMP).
On return, V contains a the date in the form DD-MMM-YY, V+5 contains the time
in the format HH:MM:SS, and V+10 contains the day of the week.
Vector V should have an upperbound of 14.
If the date is unset (days = 0) then the strings are all set to "<unset>".

Note the trailing 'S' on "dat-to-stringS"!
*ringdat
RINGDAT command
Form:           RINGDAT  "quiet/s"
Purpose:        To obtain the date from the Ring DAT service
Author:         BJK
Specification:  Prints date, time, and day of the week as received from the Ring
                DAT service unless the 'quiet' switch is used.  Sets the system
                clock to the date recived.
                Use the DAT command to display the date and time without using
                the Ring service.  (Use HELP DAT COMMAND for more information).
Example:        RINGDAT
*command
DAT command
Form:           DAT
Purpose:        To print the date, time, and day of the week.
Author:         PB (Paul Bond)
Specification:  This command does not use RDARGS.

                Uses DATSTRING (use HELP DATSTRING for info on the procedure)
                to generate time and date info.

                RINGDAT sets the date and time from the Ring (use HELP RINGDAT
                COMMAND for further information).

                The TRIPOS procedure which simply returns a numeral version of
                the time is called DATSTAMP (use HELP DATSTAMP).
                
Example:        DAT
** #I dat
DAT means Date And Time.  Various procedures exist to deal with this.  Type
one of the following for more info:

     COMMAND         Simply prints out date and time
     DATSTAMP        Proc to place a date stamp into a vector
     DATSTRING       Proc to convert current DAT to strings
     DAT-TO-STRINGS  Callseg module to convert an arbitrary date in a
                     vector into strings
     RINGDAT         Sets date and time from ring DAT service
     <CR>            To exit from HELP
