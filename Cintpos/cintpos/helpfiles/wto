WTO command
Form:           WTO  [machine] text
Purpose:        To Write To Operator's console on another machine
Author:         BJK
Specification:
        This command does not use RDARGS.  The first item on the line is
    taken as the name of the machine to which the message is to be sent.  The
    rest of the line is the message which is sent.
        Note that, in the case of a TRIPOS machine, the message will emerge
    on the user's console.  On multi-user machines, however, the message will
    be sent to the operators console.

Examples:

    WTO delta time to go to the pub?
    WTO cap onto the operators console
