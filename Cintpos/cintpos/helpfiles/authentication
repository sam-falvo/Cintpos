*command
TRIPOS itself is built to run in an unprotected environment.  However certain
commands which relate to other RING SERVICES use the facilities for
authentication available on the RING.  These commands include:
    GIVEFILE   - transfer a file to another machine
    TAKEFILE   - take a file from another machine
    STAR       - connect to another machine
    LOGON      - obtain ring authentication
    USER       - info on ring authentication UID SETs held
    UIDEDIT    - editor for manipulation of UID SETs held
    START      - obtain ring authentication (start of day)
Try HELP COMMAND <command> for further information.
*invalid
*broken
*gone
*valid
*no
*not
*none
    If you have found that your authentication has, for some reason, become
invalid use the LOGON command to regain it.  If it has timed out use the
'timeout' parameter to give it a larger number of seconds (10000 hex seconds
is about 18 hours!).

    If you cannot authenticate yourself in either the START or the LOGON
program then perhaps:

    a) you have forgotten your password:
         send mail to 'system-manager@cltripos' to ask for it to be reset
    b) you are not yet a user known to TRIPOS:
         send mail to 'system-manager@cltripos' to get installed as a new user
    c) the AOTMANAGER Z80 is broken:
         wait and try again
*password #H password
*procedure
*proc
There are a number of BCPL procedures for using the Active Object Table, and
USERAUTH and SYSAUTH authentication services on the ring.  They are available
in the users' source library.  Use HELP SOURCELIB AUTHENTICATION for info.
*service
AUTHENTICATION SERVICES:
    There are two services on the RING that provide some kind of authentication.
These are the USERAUTH which is responsible for authenticating users by password
under the AUTHENTITY 'user', and SYSAUTH which is responsible for authenticating
operating systems by password under the AUTHENTITY 'sysauth'.  Other related
services are:
        AOT-1           Active Object Table Service, responsible for UID SETs
        NEWPUID         Generates a new PUID in the reply block
*check
*am
To check to see if you are still an authentic user use the command:
                          USER
(use HELP USER COMMAND for more information about this command)
*set
*make
*become
To become an authentic user use either the START or the LOGON commands
(they need no argument for this function: but use HELP LOGON COMMAND or
HELP START COMMAND for further information on either).
*uid #H uid
*uidset #H uidset
** #I authentication
