*CALLSEG
:C.SCRATCH may be CALLSEGed with two arguments, a directory name and a mode.
The name MUST be supplied (0 is reserverd to mean that the program was called
by the CLI) and the mode is TRUE for QUIET, FALSE for 'give error messages', and
1 for 'verify all files'.

The result is TRUE if the directory existed.
*command
**
SCRATCH command
Form:           SCRATCH "dir/k,quiet/s,ver/s"
Purpose:        To delete all the unprotected files in a directory.
Author:         PB
Specification:

    If DIR is not given the "T:" directory will be scratched.

    QUIET causes no error messages to be produced, and VER lists all files.

NOTE that this is designed to be a safer operation than that below - It will not
delete protected files or directories.

     In order to delete a directory and its contents use the ALTER command to
allow deletion of a directory and delete it using the DELETE command:
                  ALTER <directory name> /D///
                  DELETE <directory name>
    See IEX for selective deletion of files in a directory.

Examples:
        SCRATCH
        SCRATCH DIR junkdir
