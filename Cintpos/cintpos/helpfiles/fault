*file
The TRIPOS fault file is in SYS:INFO.FAULTS.  If it is updated then the
BUILDFAULTTABLE command (q.v.) should be called to remake the internal table.
*rc #H rc
*faults #H rc
*command
Form:           FAULT  ",,,,,,,,,"
Purpose:        To print the text strings corresponding to the
                supplied fault code(s).
Author:         PB, rewritten by MFR
Specification:
        The numbers are stored in the file SYS:INFO.FAULTS, but are looked up
from a file SYS:INFO.FAULTS-TABLE. The command "buildfaulttable" (only on the
68000 systems) is used to convert the former to the latter.  See HELP on this.
Thus, after SYS:INFO.FAULTS has been updated, this command should be used.
        Fault numbers may be quoted in decimal or hex (prefixed by "#X").
        This command is identical to the WHY command, so that FAULT with no
arguments will interpret the return code set by the last cli command.
Example:        FAULT 182
                FAULT 294 296 199
                FAULT #XC004
*procedure
FAULT
      To convert an error code to an explanatory message.

      fault ( code )

      The object code "sys:c.fault" is called using callseg (q.v.)  The
explanatory message is written to the currently selected output stream.
See HELP FAULT COMMAND for more information.
