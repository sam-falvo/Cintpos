TASK SELECTION
     <CTRL>S which reflects "@S" can be used to select an alternative
TRIPOS task to which to interact.  It must be followed by two decimal
digits which specify the number of the task to be selected.

     For example:

        <CTRL>S02  (which reflects "@S02") gives the debugging task
     (task number 2) the console.  Any output from the task will go
     to the console (as always) and any input typed will go to this
     task.

    <CTRL>T which reflects "@T" performs a similar function except
that only the selected task will be able to output to the terminal
output from other tasks will be held.
*command
Form:           CONSOLE  "WIDTH/K,BELL/K,TAB/K,TRAN/K,HEX/K,*
                         *RUBOUT/K,IDENTIFY=ID/K"
Purpose:        To set console characteristics in the console
                handler that the current CLI is using.

    NOTE: this command is effective only when a directly connected terminal
is in use.  It is not useful when no terminal task is being used, i.e. when
connected via the TERMINAL CONCENTRATOR.  Try HELP TERMINAL CONCENTRATOR
COMMANDS for further information in this case.

Specification:

     WIDTH           The console width: must be a valid positive integer.
     BELL            A single character which will be used to signal
                     error conditions.
     TAB             Values ON or OFF.  When ON, tab characters (HT) are
                     expanded to spaces by the console handler.
                     Otherwise, they are untouched.
     TRAN            Values ON or OFF.  When ON, unprintable characters
                     are translated to ? or @Xnn on output, and the
                     console width is checked.  When OFF, all characters
                     are passed through unchanged, and the width is not
                     checked.  HEX             Only useful when TRAN is
                     on.  Has values ON or OFF.  This option specifies
                     whether ? (OFF) or @Xnn (ON) should be produced for
                     unprintable characters.
     RUBOUT          Has values VDU or VERIFY, and controls the displayed
                     effect of the rubout key and @L.
     IDENTIFY or ID  Values ON or OFF.  If ON, a number identifying the
                     issuing task is prefixed to every line of output.

    If no parameters are given, the current state of all the options
is printed as well as the console handler task number.

                CONSOLE TRAN OFF IDENTIFY
