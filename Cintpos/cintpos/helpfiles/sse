Find, Exchange, After, Before qualifiers are:
B, E    the string should occur at the Beginning, End of a line
S       Strip leading and trailing spaces from lines for the comparison
P       the string should Precisely match the line
W       the string should occur as a Word
U       the string and text should be Uppercased for the comparison
H       Here - consider only the current line
F       position the cursor at the Front of the string found, not the end
+delimiter
+slash
+delim
Valid Find, Exchange, After, Before delimiters are: /.+?-:!*,'"
+syntax
+*
The find command has the general syntax
    F q/string/                 or    F q&
and the exchange, after and before commands the general syntax
    a q/string1/string2/        or    a q&      or      a q/string1/&
where
    q   is a set (possibly empty) of qualifiers - see help FIND QUALIFIERS
    /   is a delimiter (see help FIND DELIMITERS)
    a   is A for AFTER, B for BEFORE or E for EXCHANGE
    &   means 'use the same string(s) as last time'

+insert
+load

The syntax of the Load command is
L q/file/
The only valid qualifier is D - delete file after loading it.
If no file is specified,  then an anonymous file is loaded.
+output
+copy
+send
+out
+to
The syntax of the Move and Copy commands is
m q/file/
where m is M for MOVE or C for COPY.
The only valid qualifiers are A - append to the file, and N - discard.
N may only be used with anonymous files, and causes the lines to be discarded.
If no file is specified,  then an anonymous file is written to.
The first line moved is the line that the cursor is on when the command is
issued.  The last line is the line that the cursor is on when a delimit
command is issued.  Delimit is either command dot (.) or immediate
command dot (see help page).

+control
Control commands are single CONTROL keys that are acted upon immediately.
CTRL-A,B        Upper, lower case the character over the cursor
CTRL-C          Enter or leave COMMAND mode
CTRL-D,U        Move cursor vertically DOWN, UP
CTRL-E,F        Delete from cursor to END, FRONT of line
CTRL-G          Generate a copy of the current line
CTRL-L          Delete the whole current LINE
CTRL-N,P        Switch this line with the NEXT, PREVIOUS one
CTRL-O          Obey the current command line
CTRL-Q          QUIT if no edits have been done
CTRL-R          REWIND - return to the top of the document
CTRL-S,T        Skip forwards to the next, previous word
CTRL-V          Switch the command lines
CTRL-W          Windup
CTRL-Y          Move cursor to end of screen
CTRL-Z          Windup and exit
CTRL-^          Rubout the character over the cursor
CTRL-\          Change character above cursor to space
CLEAR           Reshow the screen,
ENTER           (cifer 2632)    Enter immediate mode
SENDLINE        (cifer 2605)    Enter immediate mode
ESCAPE          (newbury)       Enter immediate mode
+immediate
+menu
Immediate commands are mainly from the keypad.
On Newburys they must be typed after ESCAPE.
1, 2    Move screen left, right
4, 5    Move screen up,   down
3       Extend immediate mode.  Further immediate commands do not need ESCAPE
6, 7    Move to bottom, top of buffer
8, 9    Perform last FIND, EXCHANGE-like command again
0       Load and delete an anonymous file
.       Start or end an anonymous move command

Alphabetic immediate commands are decoded via your MENU file (or HOME:SSE-MENU
if no menu file is quoted) into a command line. Each line of a menu file starts
with a command letter: the rest of the line is the corresponding command
line for SSE.
+normal
+*
CONTROL-C enters and leaves command mode.  CONTROL-O obeys the current line.
F q/text1/      Find next occurrence of text1 (help FIND QUALIFIERS).
A q/str1/str2/  After the next occurrence of text1 place text2. (likewise E,B)
C, M /file/     Copy lines to file, Move lines to file
L /file/        Load lines from file (see help FILE COMMANDS for L/C/M).
D, U            Move cursor vertically down, up
numberG         Goto line with given number. (No number goes to end of file)
H, @ rest       Do a HELP SSE 'rest' (likewise ?), send 'rest' to a CLI
I               Insert a newline at the cursor,
K               Delete from cursor to end of file
N, O            Abandon outstanding MOVE or COPY, Obey the other command line
Q               Quit.  Stop and abandon any edits that have been done
R               Rewind.  Return to the top of the document
numberT, V      Move current line to n'th on screen, Show verify page
W, Z, P         Windup, Windup and exit, Windup and print
numberX,numberY Set movement for horizontal(X) or vertical(Y) immediate commands
-, +, <, >      Like cursor up, down, left, right
^               Dispatch next character from command line as equivalent control
%, $, #, _      Uppercase, lowercase, delete, force to space character

SSE command
Form:           SSE   "FROM,TO,MENU/K,,BROWSE/S,OPT/K"
Purpose:        To screen edit a file
Authors:        AJW  DWS  PB
Specification:
        Edits the file given by the FROM keyword to the file given by the TO
    keyword.  If FROM is not given a new file is created and edited to TO.
    If TO is not given then FROM is edited to itself. If TO already exists, then
    on windup an attempt is made to rename it as T:EDIT-BACKUP. IF THIS FAILS,
    THE OLD VERSION IS LOST, so do not rely on this feature.
        If the BROWSE switch is used no alterations to the file are allowed to
    the file during editing.
        The MENU key word is used to specify a file which contains a set of
    pre-defined SSE commands for use whilst editing. If this is not given then
    the menu file defaults to "HOME:sse-menu" in the currently set directory.
        The unkeyed parameter ( between MENU and BROWSE ) is not used and is
    included only for future compatability with the SSE server.
        For information about the commands available use HELP SSE COMMANDS.
        NOTE: this command can only be used at a cursor addressable
              Newbury or Cifer terminal at present.
        For further information try:

    HELP SSE CONTROL COMMANDS       | for the effects of control keys
    HELP SSE NORMAL  COMMANDS       | for commands in command lines
    HELP SSE IMMEDIATE COMMANDS     | for commands after typing ESCAPE
    HELP SSE FIND COMMAND
    HELP SSE FIND QUALIFIERS
    HELP SSE FIND DELIMITERS

    SSE TO newfile                              creates newfile
    SSE infofile BROWSE                         looks at infofile
