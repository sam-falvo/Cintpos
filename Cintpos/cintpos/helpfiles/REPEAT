*command
**
Form:           command1; command2; . . . . ; REPEAT
Purpose:        To cause a line of commands to be repeatedly
                executed.
Author:         PB
Specification:
   The action of REPEAT is to 'unread' the command line it occurs
in, and then return control to the CLI.  Thus the commands before
REPEAT on the line will be repeatedly performed.
   REPEAT does nothing if the ctrl/D break flag is set.
Example:        STATUS; WAIT 5; REPEAT
