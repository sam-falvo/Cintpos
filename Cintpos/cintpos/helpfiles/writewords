WRITEWORDS
        To write a vector to the currently selected output.

        WRITEWORDS(VECTOR, N)

        Writes N words to OUTPUT() from the vector VECTOR.  Note that this
procedure cannot be used with WRCH since WRCH does its own buffering.

Arguments:

VECTOR:    A vector containing the words to be written in VECTOR!0 to
           VECTOR!(n-1)
N:         The number of words to be written.

Return:

        The specified number of words has been written to the file.

Abort condition:

        A task abort will occur if the stream does not support word
INPUT/OUTPUT.  Extremely serious errors detected during writing may also
result in an abort.
