DEBUG COMMAND

Form:           DEBUG
Purpose:        To load DEBUG as a command.  (Useful when resident
                DEBUG is not accessible - e.g. from a second
                console, or when logged-in from a remote machine).
Author:         ARA
Specification:
        Note that this command is normally resident and running as task
    two.  Thus @S02 can be used to select it.
        Use HELP DEBUG COMMANDS for explanation of commands.
        Use HELP DEBUG ALL for full documentation.
Example:        DEBUG

*spec
DEBUG spec is on the IBM in TRIPOS.ALL.SPEC:DEBUG
(Use HELP DOCUMENTATION for a full list of IBM documentation)
*remote
REMOTE DEBUG COMMAND for 68000s

Form:           IDW:68000-OBJ.REMOTE-DEBUG  "MACHINE/A"
Purpose:        To debug a crashed 68000 whose console stream has been lost.
Author:         IDW
Specification:

   The crashed machine should first be loaded with the pseudo system reset
using a reasonably long timeout period to ensure it is not lost.  This
command may then be run on another 68000.  It provides an interface very
similar to local debug.
**
DEBUG is available as a resident task (usually task 2) in most Tripos
systems. You can make use of it at any time by directing console input
to the DEBUG task (using Control-S in the normal way). In this way you can
inspect other tasks while they are still running.

A description of DEBUG is to be found in TRIPOS.ALL.SPEC:DEBUG on Phoenix.

Use: HELP DEBUG COMMANDS  for a summary of commands
     HELP DEBUG COMMAND   for details of the DEBUG command (non-resident form)
     HELP DEBUG REMOTE    to debug one (dead) 68000 remotely from another
     HELP Z80 DEBUG  )
     HELP 6809 DEBUG )    to find out about other debuggers
