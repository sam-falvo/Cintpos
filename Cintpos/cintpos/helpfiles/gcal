GCAL command
Form:           GCAL "from/a,to,index/k,aside/k,for/k,library/k,fontlib/k,opt/k"
Purpose:        Pagination
Author:         Philip Hazel (Computing Service)
Tripos version: MAJ

Warning:

  GCAL requires a global vector of at least 550.  If you are running on a
non-standard Tripos system, you should check this (with the GLOBALS command)
and increase if necessary.  GCAL is currently available on 68000 Tripos only.

Specification:

  The full specification of GCAL may be found in the series of files
SPEC.GCAL.xxx on Phoenix.

  The FROM parameter specifies the main input file.

  The TO parameter specifies the main output file.  To it is written a
"device independent" code called GCODE.  TO defaults to the current output
stream (usually the terminal), so will almost always need to be specified.

  The INDEX and ASIDE parameters specify output files for the 'index'
and 'aside' documents respectively.  GCAL will give a warning message
if they cannot be opened when required.

  The FOR parameter specifies a library member to be logically prepended
to the main input.  It allows the specification of the target device to
be deferred until pagination time.

  The LIBRARY parameter specifies a directory or device name to be used
for picking up library files with the .LIBRARY directive.  The default
is SYS:GCAL.LIBRARY.

  The library "a4cm" may be used to produce high quality output on the CANON.
  The library "a4atl" may be used to produce high quality output on an
  Apple LaserWriter.

  The OPT parameter is for specifying options to GCAL.  Most options are
debugging aids.  OPT=S, which causes additional statistics to be printed,
is the only one likely to be of interest to ordinary users.

  The FONTLIB parameter specifies a directory or device name to be used
for picking up font definitions for the .BINDFONT directive.  The default
is SYS:GCAL.FONTLIB.  See the full GCAL spec. on the IBM for further
information.  MAJ has details of character sets etc. available on Tripos.

  Fonts are referred to in GCAL using the $fn flag, where n is a number.
This is not mnemonic, so certain "standard" flags are defined for switching
font.  Some of those available are:

$rm   Roman - the "normal" font
$it   Italic
$bf   Bold
$sl   Slanted (same as italic for many fonts)
$mi
$sy
$tt   A "typewriter" font - useful for some "computer" type characters
$ss   A symbol font
$erm
$crm

No help is available on the GCAL key you specified.  HELP GCAL gives info
on the command, HELP GCAL ALL for all available info.
