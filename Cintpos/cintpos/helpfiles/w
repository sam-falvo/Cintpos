5 MINUTE WARNING

The message "*** 5 Minute Warning" appears 5 minutes before TRIPOS loggs off
a remote terminal user.  It will only appear if nothing has been written
to the terminal screen for about 25 minutes.  To prevent the session being
discarded something should be typed at the console to cause some reflection.

WIDGET COMMAND

There is currently no WIDGET command on TRIPOS.  "HELP COMMAND WIDGET" is
only used as an EXAMPLE help for an hypothetical command in the user guide.

Try something else, and don't be so pedantic.

*window
*window:
There is a Tripos window handler which enables processes to use WS windows.
To load the window handler, use:

    mount window: from sys:idw.ws-process.window-mount

Once mounted, process windows can be opened from within WS by editing the
file "*" (i.e. the terminal).  Since the control characters which Tripos
uses for breaks, task selection etc. are swallowed by WS, the following
are provided to bridge this gap:

    b, c, d, e        Break B, C, D and E
    f                 @F (flush input)
    s<n>              @S<n>  (select task <n>)
    t<n>              @T<n>  (select task <n>, exclusive output)

First, type the command into the buffer, and then use ^K* to transmit the
line to the window handler.

%count
%wordcount
The SPELL command will print out the number of words in a document.  The
CHKW command will also produce such a count (usually different)!
%mode
Tripos filing systems which use a local disc distinguish between files written
using WRCH (character files) and those written using WRITEWORDS (word files).
Character files should be read using RDCH, and word files should be read using
READWORDS.  As a result, programs such as JOIN, COPY and APPEND have keywords
CHARS and WORDS to control the way in which data is copied.

The fileserver-based filing system does not make any distinction between
character and word files.
%size
Word size is 32 bits on 68000 machines and 16 bits on LSI4s.  Programs should
if at all possible be written in a word size independent way using manifests
such as bytesperword (q.v).
%star #H ws

HELP knows about WORD COUNT, SIZE and MODE.

*writetolog
You can open a stream which will write lines to the ring log terminal by
using the procedure FINDWTO with service name WTO-LOG. See
HELP SOURCELIB FINDWTO for more information.

*wwp
WWP is a program for producing wiring schedules from circuit descriptions, for
subsequent use on the pointing machine.  The Titan Room documentation
folder contains information on the WWP program.
