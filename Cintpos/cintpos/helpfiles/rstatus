RSTATUS command
Form:           RSTATUS
Purpose:        To list the status of all stations on the Ring
Author:         BJK
Specification:
        This program to print out the names of all ring stations currently
    switched on, and how they reacted to a basic block sent to them.
        A basic block is sent to every station with address from 1 to 254,
    and the name printed for those which produce transmission return
    codes other than 'ignored'.
        [Station 0 is the error logger; sending to it will cause it to
    log false errors.  Station 255 should not exist, as no-one would be
    able to select it exclusively for reception].

Example:
        RSTATUS
