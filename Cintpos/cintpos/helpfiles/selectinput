SELECTINPUT
  To select a stream for input.
      res := selectinput ( stream )
      The stream, which should be the result of  a  call  of
findinput  (  q.v.  ) is selected and made the current input
stream. A true result is returned.
      If the stream is not valid then the routine will abort
with code 186.  Continuing the abort will cause  the  stream
to  be  selected  anyway;  however this is likely to lead to
fatal consequences later.
