   You may give the passwords on the command line, rather than as answers to
prompts.  If you do this you should type CTRL/P E before the passwords to
prevent display on the screen.  You will also have to type CTRL/P E to
suppress reflection explicitly when operating over some foreign networks!
*command

   For the syntax of passwords use HELP PASSWORD SYNTAX.

   TRIPOS user's passwords are kept in a table in the USERAUTH ring
service.  This service can also be used from the LOGON command (use HELP
LOGON COMMAND).  For further information about the authentication system
in general use HELP AUTHENTICATION.

Examples using explicit non-reflection:


    PASSWORD SET CTRL/P E wombat ferret
    Verify new password: CTRL/P E ferret

    PASSWORD CHECK CTRL/P E ferret
** #I password
