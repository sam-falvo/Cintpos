Form:           TALK  "TMES,"
Purpose:        To send a message to another console.
Author:         RDE
Specification:
   The command will print a message of the form:
   From Tn: <message>
on a console (n is the taskid of the issuing CLI).
   There are two ways of using the command:
i)  With two parameters:
   e.g. TALK 3 "Twas brillig and the slithy toves"
   In this case, the first parameter must be the task number of a
console handler, and identifies the console which is to receive the
message.
ii) With one parameter:
   e.g. TALK "And shun the frumious bandersnatch"
   In this case, the first console handler found that is not the one
used by the current CLI receives the message.
