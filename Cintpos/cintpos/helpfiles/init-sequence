INIT-SEQUENCE
    This is the name of the file in a user's home directory which is executed
as a T command when the user logs on.  Typical commands to include in an
init-sequence file are the following:
            STACK 1000              - to set the default size of a user's stack
                                      to a higher than normal value
            PROMPT <prompt>         - to give the user his own prompt
            MESSAGE tripos, OPT SQ  - to print a summary of his own and
                                      system  messages recieved
            NEWCLI                  - to create a second 'emergency' CLI
    There are various ways in which this command sequence can be executed:
either explicitly using the T or C commands or implicitly using the INIT, USER
or START commands.
    For further information use:
        HELP T COMMAND         HELP INIT COMMAND        HELP START COMMAND
        HELP USER COMMAND      HELP C COMMAND           HELP NEWCLI COMMAND
        HELP STACK COMMAND     HELP MESSAGE COMMAND     HELP PROMPT COMMAND
        HELP HOME DIRECTORY    HELP COMMAND SEQUENCE

    The file to initialise a new CLI when using the X break on the terminal
concentrator is SYS:S.NEWCLI-INITIAL-COMMANDS.  (Use HELP VIRTUAL TERMINAL
BREAK for more information).
    The file used to initialise a TRIPOS machine upon startup is
SYS:S.INITIAL-COMMANDS for multi-users versions and
SYS:S.STARTUP-COMMANDS for single user versions (the norm).
