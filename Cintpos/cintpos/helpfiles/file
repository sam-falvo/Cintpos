*command
Many TRIPOS commands manipulate files in one way or another - some of the
more important are:
    INPUT       - create a file with text given from the terminal
    COPY        - move the contents of one file to another
    RENAME      - change the name of a file
    DELETE      - delete a file
    EDIT        - alter the contents of a file
    COMPARE     - compare two files for differences
    PROTECT     - change the protection status of a file
    EX          - give information about a file
    T           - execute the commands in a file
    C           - execute the commands in a file (inserting parameters)
For information about similar commands for directories use HELP DIRECTORY
COMMANDS.  For information about other editors use HELP EDITORS.  For
information about other examine commands use HELP EXAMINE COMMANDS.
For more information about any of the above commands use
HELP <command> COMMAND.

Files are created by the INPUT command, or by FINDOUTPUT in a program.
Type INPUT COMMAND for information about the command and FINDOUTPUT for
information about the BLIB procedure.  Type <CR> to exit HELP.

*temporary
*T:
   The name T: is assigned to the directory to be used for temporary files
(e.g. by editors, JOIN, APPEND, C, etc.).  The physical directory is different
for each machine in the processor bank to avoid clashes.

   T: is also useful for creating temporary files explicitly during a
session e.g. BCPL myprog t:0 creates the program load module in file t:0.

   **** WARNING ****

   The files created in t: are not cleared up automatically, and will
remain charged to you unless you clear them explicitly.  The program SCRATCH
will do this.  It should normally be RUN AT THE END OF EVERY SESSION.

   The advantage of this system is that, if your machine should crash or
be lost for any reason, your temporary files still exist and can be retrieved.
If necessary they can be accessed from a different machine.

   In the processor bank fileserver filing system, T: is assigned to the
directory MACHINES.<machine-name>.T on the pack containing the logged-on user's
home directory.

*concatenation
*append
CONCATENATING FILES

To append one file to another use the APPEND command (use HELP APPEND COMMAND
for further information), to join several files together use the JOIN command
(use HELP JOIN COMMAND), to link several TRIPOS binary files together use
the LKED command if external symbols are involved (use HELP LKED COMMAND) and
JOIN or APPEND otherwise (e.g. BCPL programs).  There is also a pseudo-device
CONCAT: which allows a single input stream to be made from several files.
See HELP CONCAT: for more information.
*delete #H delete
*deletion #H delete
*size
*bytes
*date
*time
*examine
*status
For the size of a file or directory in bytes and its date and time of creation
and its protection status use the EX command (e.g. EX <file>).
This command will list all the files and sub directories of a directory.
Use HELP EX COMMANDS for further information.
*transfer
*ring
*bsp
*cap
*ibm
*bbc
*send
*give
*get
*take
*receive
*pds
*ttp
Commands for transferring files are as follows:
        GIVEFILE    -  send file to ring machine
        TAKEFILE    -  take file from ring machine
        FROMPHX     -  take file from Phoenix
        CS          -  multi-option command for Phoenix transfers
        TOBBC       -  send file to BBC microcomputer
        FROMBBC     -  receive file from BBC microcomputer
For further information about one of these commands use HELP COMMAND <command>,
*title
*filename
*name
FILE NAMES

File titles may consist of any alphanumeric symbol or the character minus
(-).  Each component of the name may be up to thirty characters in length.
Cases of letters are equated.  If the file name begins with a colon (:) it
refers to the file whith the following name looked up in the root directory.
If it does not begin with a colon it is looked up in the currently set
directory (use HELP SET COMMAND for information about how to set it).
A file name preceeded by "<name of directory>." refers to the file with
the following name looked up in the directory <name of directory> in the
currently context (set directory).  Directory names are treated in the same
way.
*account #H accounting
*accounting #H accounting
*anon #H anon
*anonymous #H anon
*open
Files which have been left open by accident, and so cannot be accessed,
can be closed by reloading your machine.  This re-initialises the Filing
Machine session, closing the files.  If you just drop the machine, then
the FM session will time out after a few minutes and close the files.
*directory #H directory
*directories #H directory
*dir #H directory
** #I file
