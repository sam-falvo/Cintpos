    Globals from LIBHDR may be slightly different depending upon which
machine you are on: use HELP LSI4 GLOBAL <arg> or HELP 68000 GLOBAL <arg>
where <arg> is either a number or a global's name.
%*
    The default number of GLOBALS allowed in a BCPL program running as a
CLI command is 350 - this default can be changed using the GLOBALS command
(use HELP GLOBALS COMMAND).
    For a program running as a task, the correct size of global vector is
obtained automatically on task activation.
%
*default
The default value of a global is undefined.  The default number of globals
can be found using HELP DEFAULT NUMBER OF GLOBALS.
*globals
*command
Form:           GLOBALS  <number>
Purpose:        To print or change the number of globals available
                to a CLI task.
Author:         ARA
Specification:
    If no number is specified, then the current size of the CLI
global vector is printed.  Otherwise, the CLI task is recreated with
the specified number of globals (minimum 200).
    Use HELP DEFAULT GLOBALS for information about the default number of
GLOBALS available to a command.
    Use HELP LSI4 GLOBAL <name or number> or HELP 68000 GLOBAL ... to
find the value of any particular LIBHDR global.

Example:        GLOBALS
                GLOBALS 450

Some globals are set by TRIPOS and may be read by user commands and tasks:
  CIS           The SCB of the current input stream (use INPUT() to read this)
  CONSOLETASK   The task ID of the console handler for this task
  COS           The SCB of the current output stream (use OUTPUT() to read this)
  CURRENTDIR    A lock on the currently set directory
  RESULT2       Used to return a second result from BCPL calls. Contains
                a fault code when the primary result indicates failure.
  STACKBASE     The address of the current coroutine stack
  TASKID        The ID of this task
  TCB           The address of this task's Task Control Block
** #I global
GLOBALS

    In TRIPOS, there is one BCPL global vector per task.  Commands
running under a CLI share the CLI's global vector. Programs should not
define any globals with numbers less than the manifest value UG, to avoid
clashing with system globals.

  For further information, type one of the following:

  COMMAND       -    GLOBALS command
  SHOW          -    Show the globals used by a program
  NUMBER        -    info on number of globals available to a task or command
  SYSTEM        -    info on global variables set by TRIPOS
  LSI4 <n>      -    info on LSI4 global number <n>
  LSI4 <name>   -    info on LSI4 global name <name>
  68000 <n>     -    info on 68000 global number <n>
  68000 <name>  -    info on 68000 global name <name>
  <CR>:      to leave HELP
