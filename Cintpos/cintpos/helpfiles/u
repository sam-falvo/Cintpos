UID stands for Unique IDentifier.  In the ring system the term is usually
applied to UIDs belonging to the file server or to the authentication
system.  See HELP FILESERVER for brief information on that.  Authentication
UIDs are usually used in groups called UIDSETs.  See HELP UIDSET for more
information.  UIDs of various sorts are used for internal object
representation in some operating systems (but not Tripos!).  See the detailed
spec. of these systems for information.

*undefglobal
*undefglobval
The CLI resets all user globals to the value CLI.UNDEFGLOBVAL (global 135)
between commands. On most implementations of Tripos, all undefined globals
have the same value. However, on 68000s the global number is encoded into the
'undefined' value, so undefined globals in a CLI will all appear to be global
135.
