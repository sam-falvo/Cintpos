This directory (posxiles) holds files of the Cintpos system in
compressed encoded form generated by the xcencode command.

cintpos-files is the list of files to encode.

The Makefile provides the following commands

make           Output this help information
make all       Create the encoded file cintpos.xc
make SONY8GB   Copy posfiles directory to SONY8GB mem stick
make HPA8GB    Copy posfiles directory to HPA8GB mem stick
make SANDISC32 Copy posfiles directory to SANDISC32 mem stick

The directory posxfiles is then transferred to a Ford desktop using a
memory stick.  From the desktop the files in posxfiles are transferred
to netint using ftp in BIN mode. Make sure the target files do not
exist before the transfer since they may have the wrong file format.

bmakefile is used by bmake running under cintsys on netint to convert
the file format of cintpos.xc to something suitable for xcdecode to
use. The converted file is called cintpos.xc1. bmakefile is invoked in
directory [.posxfiles] by the commands

cd [.distribution.Cintpos.cintpos.posxfiles]
cintsys
bmake all

This creates cintpos.xc1 in directory posxfiles. This can then be
expanded by following commands in directory
[.distribution.Cintpos.cintpos]

cintsys
bmake decodeall

It expects the following directories to exist in [.distribution.Cintpos.cintpos]

com
posxfiles
g
sysb
sysc
